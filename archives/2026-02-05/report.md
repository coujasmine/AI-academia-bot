## Entrepreneurship

### 1. [Ecosystem conditions and the efficacy of entrepreneurial support organizations: Moderating effects on venture entry](https://doi.org/10.1002/sej.70015)

> Abstract Research Summary Using a panel of 2688 city‐year observations of German fintech ventures and entrepreneurial support organizations (ESOs), we examine how ESO presence relates to venture entry. We argue and demonstrate that this relationship is contingent on local founding conditions. We find that ESO presence is most strongly associated with entry in thin ecosystems, while this association weakens in more active and developed contexts. Patterns in entries of non‐supported versus ESO‐supported ventures, along with differences across ESO types, support our argument that primarily ecosystem‐level bridging mechanisms, such as legitimacy diffusion, knowledge spillovers, and access to relational networks, are sensitive to local conditions, whereas direct support provided by ESOs to prog...

`FT50` `Innovation-Core`

> Careers in creative crafts are perceived to be precarious: workers face constant rejection and receive low and erratic pay. Yet, some creative craft workers handle these challenges better than others. Precarity sometimes subsides as careers progress, and the core-periphery structure that typifies creative craft production systems is navigable. This raises the question of how creative craft workers can cope productively with the precarity of craft work. We research a prominent creative craft worker collective: country music songwriters. Our study captures the voices of 90 creative craft workers, drawing on secondary interviews with 66 songwriters working at the core of Nashville’s highly corporatized country music production system, and 24 operating at its social and spatial periphery. We f...

`FT50` `Innovation-Core`

> Abstract Organizations today operate in a new information environment, where changing technologies have enabled fundamentally different forms and pathways of information creation and dissemination while also generating unintended consequences – chief among them increased polarization. In combination, the new information environment and polarization have profoundly altered the social processes underpinning social evaluations. To animate social evaluations research on these issues, we consider how information environment shifts and increased polarization affect the value and durability of five social evaluation types – legitimacy, reputation, status, celebrity/infamy, and stigma/esteem. We highlight the implications for both theorizing about and empirically studying social evaluations in an ...

**Authors:** Toby Newstead, Saeed Loghman, Alexander Newman, Ronald E. Riggio

`FT50` `Innovation-Core`

> Abstract Humanity – the virtue enabling meaningful human connection – is vital to the leadership we need to survive our polycrisis context. As a prerequisite to sustainable human community, the virtue of humanity is considered universal. It has been claimed as a ‘higher‐order virtue’, comprised of and enacted by – but irreducible to – a suite of ‘lower‐order virtues’ such as compassion and kindness. This claim is evident in widely‐adopted virtues catalogues, but we lack consensus on how humanity is defined, and which attributes qualify as its virtuous dimensions. To address this, we develop a robust definition of humanity and apply criteria distilled from virtue ethics to theorize the lower‐order virtues that comprise its virtuous dimensions. We thus determine the virtuous dimensions of hu...

> Parties in an alliance aim to capture both common and private benefits. As they transfer and jointly create knowledge to generate common gains, differences in private benefits can arise due to asymmetric knowledge spillovers. Our model of alliance structural choices incorporates the alliance itself—the channel through which partner knowledge flows—to reflect the fact that partners and the alliance may operate in different industry contexts. We propose that partners select structural governance mechanisms (equity governance and alliance scope) to enable valuable knowledge flows while protecting themselves from unwanted spillovers. Analyzing a large sample of U.S. alliances from 1985 to 2024, we find that asymmetric distance predicts these governance choices and that it is linked to the simu...

> Social media have fundamentally reshaped how organizations and audiences interact, challenging theoretical assumptions in the management literature. With this integrative literature review, we take stock of a fragmented body of research, based on an analysis of 647 articles across 9 disciplines. Our synthesis identifies three dominant perspectives: an organization-centric perspective that views social media as tools for strategic action; an audience-centric perspective that emphasizes audience empowerment and contestation; and a platform-centric perspective that highlights how platform features and algorithms condition organizational outcomes and audience interactions. Building on these perspectives, we develop an integrative framework of organizational enablement, audience empowerment, an...

**Authors:** Xi Chen, Jiaosha Chen, Jin Chen, Ruining Cao

**Journal:** Journal of Management Studies (JMS) | **Published:** 2026-01-29 | **Open Access**

`FT50` `Innovation-Core`

> Abstract Prior entrepreneurial network literature has primarily examined how entrepreneurs’ networking efforts facilitate interorganizational exchanges, while giving little attention to the agency of their contacts. In this study, we investigate how contacts’ intra‐organizational status shapes their actions of referring entrepreneurs to their organizations for acquisition. Drawing on middle‐status conformity theory and interviews, we argue that, compared to high‐ or low‐status actors, middle‐status actors are more concerned about status loss and face a higher likelihood of such loss; therefore, they have a lower tendency to connect entrepreneurs with their organizations, resulting in a U‐shaped effect of contact status on referring actions including quantity, quality, and efficiency.

### 1. [Overcoming barriers? The mixed results of social innovation accelerator programs for women entrepreneurs](https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.70064)

**Authors:** Nilanjana Dutt, Sarah Kaplan

**Journal:** Strategic Management Journal (SMJ) | **Published:** 2026-01-29 | **Open Access**

`FT50` `UTD24` `Innovation-Core`

> Abstract Research Summary Entrepreneurship accelerators are increasingly promoted as structural interventions to close gender gaps, yet studies have not established a differential impact of participation for women. This prior evidence—drawn from high‐tech, male‐dominated settings—may overlook how outcomes differ in more feminized domains such as social innovation. Using unique multi‐level data from 1417 ventures applying to 33 accelerators, we examine whether average effects conceal variation across institutional environments and program designs. We find that in more gender‐egalitarian countries, women‐led ventures performed better than peers after participating, especially in programs aiming to support women. In less egalitarian environments, however, participation offered negative or no ...

## Organization

### 1. [Trajectory Normalizing Work in Unstable Production Environments: When Adapting Production Means Appearing Authentic](https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19496)

**Authors:** Alan Zhang

**Journal:** Organization Science (OrgSci) | **Published:** 2026-01-30

`FT50` `UTD24` `Innovation-Core`

> Organizations emphasize specific production practices to deal with authenticity pressures, but the practices that signal authenticity to audiences must be continually adapted when production environments are unstable. Changes in the environment can make production practices suddenly infeasible, compelling organizations to perform in different ways the highly visible practices that audiences have come to associate with authenticity. However, authenticity research tends to take the continuity of production practices for granted, focusing on whether certain practices are made visible or not, and leaving unexamined how practices are made legible as they are adapted. Drawing on 16 months of ethnographic fieldwork at a renowned winery (Cal-Cru), I identify a novel form of authenticity work—traje...

> Loyalty programs are widespread across various markets, offering members rewards based on their past purchases for future benefits. This study offers new insights into the strategic use of loyalty programs and their impact on market competition by exploring the dynamics of loyalty programs within a repeated ordered search framework, in which consumers sequentially search for the optimal product across multiple firms over two periods. Our findings highlight distinct roles for price discounts and rewards in influencing consumer decisions. Price discounts discourage further search in the current shopping period, whereas rewards encourage consumer loyalty by inducing prominence in subsequent visits. As search costs increase, firms tend to offer lower price discounts but higher rewards, and thi...

`FT50` `UTD24` `Innovation-Related`

> This paper examines the impact of female analyst coverage on firms’ environmental and social (E&amp;S) performance. Exploiting broker closures as a quasi-exogenous shock to analyst coverage, we find that firms experiencing an exogenous decline in female analyst coverage subsequently show a significantly larger drop in E&amp;S scores than those experiencing an equivalent decline in male analyst coverage. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we develop novel machine-learning models to analyze more than 2.4 million analyst reports and 120,000 earnings call transcripts. Our analysis shows that, compared with their male counterparts, female analysts are more likely to address E&amp;S issues, particularly those involving regulatory compliance, stakeholders, and the environment, in both research...

`FT50` `UTD24` `Innovation-Related`

> This paper studies price and liquidity dynamics in the presence of costly short-selling when uninformed traders have limited willingness-to-pay to trade securities. In this setting, unraveling and Bayesian social learning interact to produce a novel mechanism, dynamic unraveling: Unraveling that generates signals that lead to future unraveling. Applying the theory, I show how dynamic unraveling explains low-volume crashes: falls in the prices of securities on low or declining trading volume. In this context, short-selling restrictions can make low-volume crashes more likely by intensifying dynamic unraveling, but liquidity injections have the opposite effect.

`FT50` `UTD24` `Innovation-Related`

> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reviews firms’ financial reports and issues comment letters to ensure compliance with applicable disclosure and accounting requirements. We explore the nature, determinants, and consequences of SEC comment letters that refer to information disclosed in voluntary earnings conference calls. Using hand-collected data, we document that the SEC primarily references these voluntary disclosures to illustrate insufficiencies and, less commonly, inconsistencies in mandatory filings across a wide range of topics. These letters are more likely to be issued when filing reviews are more complex, SEC staff are less resource constrained, and for firms with more institutional investors and analysts. Conference call–related comments tend to occur during higher-q...

`FT50` `UTD24`

> How should firms best communicate their corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts? Across seven preregistered studies (two large field studies and five online lab experiments), we find that making a series of periodic contributions, e.g., donating $20,000 per month for 12 months, rather than donating an equivalent aggregate amount, e.g., donating $240,000 in a year, improves outcomes for donor companies such as reputation, customer engagement, and purchase likelihood. The benefits of periodic donations arise primarily due to heightened judgments of the donor’s authentic prosocial motivation, which affects outcomes in two ways. Via one process pathway, the consistency of periodic donations increases judgments that the donor gave due to authentic prosocial motives, which then increases f...

**Journal:** Journal of Marketing Research (JMR) | **Published:** 2026-01-29

`FT50` `UTD24`

> The rise of content-creation technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) has reshaped the way people produce and consume content. These technologies democratize content creation, enabling inexperienced individuals to generate content that rivals the quality produced by professionals. This paper adopts a game-theoretic model to study how the democratization of content creation affects welfare. While the content-democratization technology can assist low-quality creators in improving their content quality, it can precipitate a flood of such content in the market and crowd out high-quality content production, leading to welfare losses. An incremental technology development with low reduction in quality gap can hurt individual consumers and all creators, leading to a lose-l...

### 1. [Online Facility Location: Running Stores on Wheels with Spatial Demand Learning](https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2024.1244)

**Authors:** Junyu Cao, Wei Qi, Yan Zhang

**Journal:** Manufacturing & Service Operations Management (MSOM) | **Published:** 2026-02-02

`FT50` `UTD24`

> Problem definition: A shift toward shopping at (autonomous) wheeled vending stores is redefining urban retail. Compared with traditional brick-and-mortar stores, such mobile stores are cost efficient to deploy and adaptive to fast-evolving business environments. However, mobile stores are confronted with unknown demand and limited capacity. Store mobility enables demand learning and profit maximization, yet an optimal dynamic store location policy remains unclear. Methodology/results: We model this “learning-and-earning” problem by taking optimistic actions under parameter uncertainty. The joint optimization over parameter and action set is complicated by the combinatorial nature and infinite choices within the action set. We overcome these challenges by leveraging continuous-approximation...

**Authors:** Yoko Shibuya, Volodymyr Babich

**Journal:** Manufacturing & Service Operations Management (MSOM) | **Published:** 2026-02-02

`FT50` `UTD24`

> Problem definition: Supply chain financing solutions allow financially weaker suppliers to secure funding based on the stronger financial standing of their buyers, presenting an alternative to conventional financing. This paper explores the preferences between immediate-tier financing (involving a direct buyer of the supplier) and remote-tier financing (involving a buyer’s buyer). Methodology/results: Using a model of a three-tier supply chain and a financial market, we solve for the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium for a game comprising supply chain financing supergame and financing subgames between a firm and investors, subject to equilibrium pricing of firms’ assets-in-place and moral hazard frictions. The game is dynamic and stochastic because production shocks and financing subgames o...

**Journal:** Production and Operations Management (POM) | **Published:** 2026-01-29

`FT50` `UTD24`

> We study multi-period risk-averse inventory control in a data-driven setting. In this problem, a risk-averse retailer makes periodic decisions on inventory levels based only on historical demand observations without full knowledge of the demand distribution. We adopt the popular nested formulation for risk-averse programs to formulate this multi-period problem and its data-driven counterpart under a coherent risk measure. Our objective is to study the sample complexity bound such that with high probability, the data-driven policy is near-optimal, i.e., the relative error of risk under the data-driven policy compared with the optimal risk is arbitrarily small. Analysis of this problem is inherently challenging, because the multi-period nature requires solving the risk-averse program and its...

> In the presence of supplier quality risk, offering suppliers a higher procurement price or increasing inspection effort are two approaches to motivate a supplier to invest in higher quality. In this paper, we consider three sourcing and inspection strategies for a brand with two branch shops facing supplier quality risk: joint, mixed, and independent strategies. Under the joint strategy, the brand jointly sources for its two shops by offering a uniform procurement price and inspects for both shops in a centralized way (joint sourcing and joint inspection). Under the mixed strategy, the brand jointly sources for its two shops by offering a procurement price and then each shop decides its own inspection probability (joint sourcing and independent inspection). Under the independent strategy, ...

> Blockchain technology holds promise for improving access to financing within supply chains, especially for small and under-financed suppliers. Yet, the specific ways in which blockchain technology mitigates financing frictions and the features that contribute to successful platform implementations remain unclear. Following a theory elaboration approach, we close that gap by studying which financing frictions the BCF solutions aim to address, which blockchain features they use, and the association between the frictions and features. In our analysis, we examine 312 documents with unstructured text describing 11 BCF solutions, both successful and failed. Using AI-based large language models, we identify patterns connecting seven types of financing frictions and three key blockchain features. ...

> The United States and other countries enacted various policies aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19. Though the pandemic itself took a physical, psychological, and economic toll on society, it is unclear how specific containment policies influenced longer term aspects of employment. Taking up this challenge, this research uses human agency theory to study the effects of U.S. state policy COVID-19 strictness, defined along the spectrum from the absence to the presence (e.g., none, recommended, and mandated) of nine containment policies, on critical macro and micro outcomes. Study 1, using an objective measure of public containment policies enacted during 2020, finds stricter policies (i.e., more restrictions) negatively related to opportunity-based entrepreneurship in 2021.

**Authors:** Mohamed Genedy, Lucia Naldi, Karin Hellerstedt, Johan Wiklund

**Journal:** Human Resource Management (HRM) | **Published:** 2026-02-01 | **Open Access**

`FT50`

> ABSTRACT New ventures are expected to continuously add new jobs and managerial positions to meet the expanding demands of scaling. However, the rapid pace and inherent uncertainty of scaling often lead founders of new ventures to rely on heuristics when making these critical hiring and managerial appointment decisions. By integrating research on scaling, cognition in decision‐making, and gender stereotypes with literature on HR practices, we argue that such heuristics can exacerbate reliance on gender stereotypes rather than the actual competencies of potential candidates. Using matched employer‐employee census data covering all new ventures established and led by solo male founders in Sweden between 2004 and 2018, we find that scaling decreases the likelihood of hiring females for job pos...

**Journal:** Human Relations (HR) | **Published:** 2026-01-31 | **Open Access**

`FT50`

> This study investigates how disparities in access to telework arrangements within organizations influence collective outcomes. By incorporating social identity with justice theories, we develop a conceptual model and hypothesize that greater dispersion in organizational telework access correlates with diminished organizational performance, primarily due to its association with lower collective positive affective tone. However, we argue that collective organizational identification can mitigate this negative impact. Our empirical analysis, leveraging a multisource dataset of 26,783 employees across 186 companies, substantiates this model. These findings advocate for the importance of intra-organizational variation of telework access in enriching our understanding of both the advantages and ...

> ABSTRACT This paper investigates how consulting services affect audit quality, from the perspective of knowledge- and expertise-sharing between employees. Semistructured interviews with 16 audit partners reveal that consulting expertise is used in 60–80 percent of audit engagements, with the main rationale for such collaboration being knowledge-sharing and improved audit quality. We leverage a comprehensive office-level dataset of employment profiles covering 86 percent of all employees at large U.S. public accounting firms to systematically investigate the effect of consulting employees on audit quality. We document that a one standard deviation increase in the share of consulting employees in an office results in a 2.6 percentage point reduction in restatements (a decrease of 19 percent ...

> ABSTRACT Accounting is often thought of in terms of numbers and abstract models, yet it is sustained in practice by a host of ordinary objects. This paper demonstrates how seemingly mundane items—blackboards, cue cards, flipcharts, sticky notes, envelopes, and boxes—can play quiet yet decisive roles in extending and connecting accounting into new settings. Borrowing from literature on everyday surface aesthetics, we introduce the notion of geometric mediation to denote how certain arrangements of mundane objects can draw us in, appearing so compelling that they invite us to connect the abstract logics associated with them. We illustrate this process through a study of the Logical Framework, a performance tool for nongovernmental organizations, and its transformation when adopted by a Germa...

> ABSTRACT We study the implications of inflation heterogeneity for individuals and firms through the lens of accounting research, applying measurement frameworks to the national accounting measurement of inflation. We first examine the systematic exposure of individuals in low‐income households to higher inflation relative to those in high‐income households. We show that this “inflation gap” is linked with future rising inequality in the form of widening gaps in healthcare insurance, education, homeownership, and credit card debt, as well as in a higher frequency of property crimes. We also provide an economic mechanism connecting the inflation gap with rising inequality, empirically demonstrating the role of basic goods in reducing the ability of individuals in the low‐income group to atta...

> We assess whether men and women are treated differently when presenting their economics research. We collected data across thousands of seminars, job market talks, and conference presentations, leveraging human judgment and audio-processing algorithms to measure the number, tone, and type of interruptions. Within a seminar series, women are interrupted more than men. This holds when controlling for characteristics of the presenter, paper, and audience. Interruptions that are negative in tenor or tone or cut off the presenter mid-sentence increase for women presenters. We also find greater engagement of female audience members with female presenters, suggesting a potential role model effect. (JEL A11, C45, J16, J44)

We revalue New York City office buildings, taking into account both the cash flow and discount rate implications of these shocks, and find a 46 percent decline in long-run value. For all US office markets combined, we find a $556.8 billion value destruction. Higher-quality buildings were buffered against these trends due to a flight to quality, while lower-quality offices are at risk of becoming a stranded asset. These valuation changes have repercussions for financial stability and local public finances. (JEL E31, E32, G12, J22, M51, R33)

> This paper studies the efficiency of self-enforced relational agreements, a common solution to contracting frictions, when sellers have market power and contracts cannot be externally enforced. To this end, I develop a dynamic contracting model with limited enforcement in which buyers can default on their trade credit debt and estimate it using a novel dataset from the Ecuadorian manufacturing supply chain. The key empirical finding is that bilateral trade is inefficiently low in early periods of the relationship, but converges toward efficiency over time, despite sellers’ market power. Counterfactual simulations imply that both market power and enforcement contribute to inefficiencies in trade. (JEL D86, G32, K12, L14, L60, O14)

> We argue that consumer credit spreads matter for household choices and that time-varying spreads have important distributional consequences. Studying Danish household data, we show that consumer credit spreads have heterogeneous impact on asset dynamics and consumption choices across the wealth distribution and that time-varying spreads induce a countercyclical marginal propensity to consume. We study a HANK model where banks provide consumer credit and corporate loans. Through countercyclical credit spreads, frictional finance amplifies aggregate shocks and induces consumption inequality. Economies with less leveraged banks experience reduced aggregate volatility but may face higher volatility and lower welfare at the household level. (JEL D12, D31, E12, E21, E32, E52, G51)

> Captive finance subsidiaries create a channel for trade policy to affect consumer credit. Examining the impact of the Trump administration’s metal tariffs on captive automobile lenders, we find that consumers received higher interest rates from captive lenders after the tariffs relative to unaffected noncaptive lenders. Further, we document a disparate impact on low-income borrowers and in areas with less lending competition. Our results suggest that tariffs may impact not only the price of goods but also the financing terms of purchases. Thus, focusing solely on directly affected product prices may underestimate tariff pass-through significantly. (JEL F13, F14, G21, L22, L61, L62)

> We study the effects of intensifying competition for contracts in the context of US Defense procurement. Leveraging a discontinuous regulation that mandates agencies to publicize certain contract opportunities, we document that expanding the set of bidders reduces award prices but deteriorates post-award performance in terms of cost overruns and delays. We develop and estimate an auction model with endogenous entry and stochastic execution performance, in which the buyer endogenously chooses the intensity of competition. Model estimates indicate substantial heterogeneity in performance across contractors and show that simple adjustments to the current regulation could provide significant savings in procurement spending.

This class of models explains observed adjustments in economic activity. Standard value-of-time calculations capture only 52 percent of welfare gains.

> Modern theories of aggregate supply are built on the foundation that firms set prices and commit to producing whatever the market demands. We remove this strategic restriction and allow firms to choose supply functions, mappings that describe the prices charged at each quantity of production. Theoretically, we characterize firms’ optimal supply function choices in general equilibrium and study the resulting implications for aggregate supply. Aggregate supply flattens under lower inflation uncertainty, higher idiosyncratic demand uncertainty, and less elastic demand. Quantitatively, our theory can rationalize the flattening of aggregate supply during the Great Moderation and steepening during the 1970s and 2020s. (JEL D21, D43, E13, E23, E31, E32)

> We show that subjective assessments of employee “potential” contribute to gender gaps in promotion and pay. Using data on 29,809 management-track employees from a large retail chain, we find that women receive substantially lower potential ratings despite receiving higher performance ratings. Differences in potential ratings account for approximately half of the gender promotion gap. Women’s lower potential ratings do not reflect accurate forecasts of future performance: Women subsequently outperform male colleagues, both on average and on the margin of promotion. We highlight two mechanisms driving the gender potential gap: strategic retention and stereotyping. (JEL J16, J31, J71, L81, M12, M51)

> Principal-agent problems often extend beyond what can be directly addressed through conventional incentive arrangements. We examine a context where physicians are likely under-incentivized to minimize total medical costs until their private financial interests align with those of patients. Leveraging novel data on physician ownership of ambulatory surgery centers——that is, same-day facilities——we show that these equity holdings cause a substitution away from higher cost, rival settings that lowers Medicare spending by 10–40 percent per physician. We find no clear evidence of perverse behavior following these investments. Instead, our findings demonstrate how entrepreneurial activity can indirectly limit principal-agent problems and improve efficiency. (JEL D82, D91, G51, I11, I18, L84)

> Abstract This paper studies the effects of automation in a task-based economy in which some jobs pay workers rents—wages above their outside option. We show that automation targets high-rent tasks, dissipating rents, amplifying wage losses, and reducing within-group wage dispersion in exposed groups. This form of rent dissipation is inefficient and offsets the productivity gains from automation. Using US data from 1980 to 2016, we find evidence of sizable rent dissipation and reduced within-group wage dispersion due to automation. Automation accounts for 52% of the increase in between-group inequality since 1980, with rent dissipation explaining one-fifth of this total. Our estimates imply that inefficient rent dissipation has offset 60–90% of the productivity gains from automation over th...

Linked regulation allows inspectors who uncover violations at one plant to increase future enforcement at other plants that share a common owner. When compliance costs are correlated, regulators can then target scarce enforcement resources towards bad actors without inspecting everyone. We develop an empirical framework of dynamic moral hazard under linked regulation that allows for large portfolios of plants and for choices to be interdependent within the portfolio of plants and across time. Using the framework we evaluate a linked regulation scheme in Texas and find that linked regulation performs substantially better than both unlinked regulation and untargeted regulation. We test two alternative theoretical...

We also develop a research agenda addressing these gaps within debates on political corporate social responsibility (PCSR).

By reviewing gardening literatures, and exploring our embodied gardening practices, we attempt to ‘step out’ of institutionalised ways of thinking and working to reach for different embodied and relational ways of being with earth-others. We contribute to debates by: (a) tracing multispecies mutualities of ‘cutting-together apart’ within the gardens we tend, to show how such cutting can develop understandings of an entangled ethics in which human involvement can at times be peripheral; and, (b) showing how garden(ing)s can hel...
