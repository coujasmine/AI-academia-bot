    "abstract": "Loyalty programs are widespread across various markets, offering members rewards based on their past purchases for future benefits. This study offers new insights into the strategic use of loyalty programs and their impact on market competition by exploring the dynamics of loyalty programs within a repeated ordered search framework, in which consumers sequentially search for the optimal product across multiple firms over two periods. Our findings highlight distinct roles for price discounts and rewards in influencing consumer decisions. Price discounts discourage further search in the current shopping period, whereas rewards encourage consumer loyalty by inducing prominence in subsequent visits. As search costs increase, firms tend to offer lower price discounts but higher rewards, and this results in a higher industry profit but lower consumer surplus. Compared with their absence, loyalty programs decrease both industry profit and consumer welfare, leading to a lose–lose outcome. Moreover, we demonstrate that, when the firms are heterogeneous in terms of their network sizes, those with larger networks tend to offer lower rewards yet achieve greater consumer loyalty in contrast to the firms with smaller networks, which compensate with higher rewards.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of female analyst coverage on firms’ environmental and social (E&amp;S) performance. Exploiting broker closures as a quasi-exogenous shock to analyst coverage, we find that firms experiencing an exogenous decline in female analyst coverage subsequently show a significantly larger drop in E&amp;S scores than those experiencing an equivalent decline in male analyst coverage. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we develop novel machine-learning models to analyze more than 2.4 million analyst reports and 120,000 earnings call transcripts. Our analysis shows that, compared with their male counterparts, female analysts are more likely to address E&amp;S issues, particularly those involving regulatory compliance, stakeholders, and the environment, in both research reports and earnings conference calls. They also display distinct cognitive and linguistic patterns when discussing E&amp;S issues. Furthermore, female analysts are more likely to issue lower stock recommendations and target prices (lower stock recommendations) following negative E&amp;S discussions in their reports (E&amp;S incidents) than male analysts. Finally, investors respond more strongly to female analysts’ negative tones when discussing E&amp;S issues. Overall, our findings suggest that gender diversity among analysts plays a significant role in shaping corporate E&amp;S practices and provide new insights into the origins of gender differences in skills within the equity analyst profession.

    "abstract": "The United States and other countries enacted various policies aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19. Though the pandemic itself took a physical, psychological, and economic toll on society, it is unclear how specific containment policies influenced longer term aspects of employment. Taking up this challenge, this research uses human agency theory to study the effects of U.S. state policy COVID-19 strictness, defined along the spectrum from the absence to the presence (e.g., none, recommended, and mandated) of nine containment policies, on critical macro and micro outcomes. Study 1, using an objective measure of public containment policies enacted during 2020, finds stricter policies (i.e., more restrictions) negatively related to opportunity-based entrepreneurship in 2021. Study 2, using the same public policy strictness measure and a national sample of 801 participants, finds strict policies in 2020 negatively related to residents' entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) in 2024, which in turn related to their entrepreneurial intentions and quality of work life (QWL). The hypothesized interaction between state policy and sex on ESE was not significant, but post hoc analysis reveals that women residing in states with stricter policies reported lower life and career satisfaction than women in states with less strict policies and that the effects of state policy strictness on career and life satisfaction were more negative for women than for men. A supplemental preregistered experimental vignette study reinforced Study 2 findings such that manipulated state policy strictness caused a decrease in ESE, entrepreneurial intentions, and QWL; manipulated ESE also had a significant effect on entrepreneurial intentions and QWL. We discuss the broader implications of these results for theory and policymaking. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2026 APA, all rights reserved).",

    "abstract": "Problem definition: A shift toward shopping at (autonomous) wheeled vending stores is redefining urban retail. Compared with traditional brick-and-mortar stores, such mobile stores are cost efficient to deploy and adaptive to fast-evolving business environments. However, mobile stores are confronted with unknown demand and limited capacity. Store mobility enables demand learning and profit maximization, yet an optimal dynamic store location policy remains unclear. Methodology/results: We model this “learning-and-earning” problem by taking optimistic actions under parameter uncertainty. The joint optimization over parameter and action set is complicated by the combinatorial nature and infinite choices within the action set. We overcome these challenges by leveraging continuous-approximation methods, and then, we propose a continuous-approximation optimistic (CA-O) learning framework under some special problem structures. Nevertheless, for more general scenarios, the problem remains intricate because of the nonconvexity in unknown parameters. We alternatively propose a CA-O faster learning algorithm by utilizing first-order approximation techniques and further proving a closed-form gradient to guarantee computational efficiency. We theoretically analyze and numerically validate the regret for the proposed algorithms. Managerial implications: In a Toronto case study, our algorithm significantly outperforms baselines. Mobile stores earn higher profits than brick-and-mortar stores through demand learning and store mobility. More broadly, this paper envisions the future landscape of urban retail enhanced by omnipresent mobile facilities. Funding: W.

    ],
    "abstract": "Problem definition: Supply chain financing solutions allow financially weaker suppliers to secure funding based on the stronger financial standing of their buyers, presenting an alternative to conventional financing. This paper explores the preferences between immediate-tier financing (involving a direct buyer of the supplier) and remote-tier financing (involving a buyer’s buyer). Methodology/results: Using a model of a three-tier supply chain and a financial market, we solve for the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium for a game comprising supply chain financing supergame and financing subgames between a firm and investors, subject to equilibrium pricing of firms’ assets-in-place and moral hazard frictions. The game is dynamic and stochastic because production shocks and financing subgames occur over time, coinciding with trade transactions between firms, and because of the stochastic evolution of information about firms’ assets-in-place affecting demand for products of each firm. We identify three economic mechanisms that stem from the relative position of firms in the supply chain and that work against remote-tier financing: risk spillover, noise accumulation, and loss of hedging options. Risk spillover occurs when a firm’s pledge of assets to secure supplier financing increases its own financing risk, affecting upstream firms and transactions. Noise accumulation refers to the greater uncertainty in forecasts of asset values, which are realized later for remote-tier buyers. The loss of the hedging option occurs because, by helping the supplier initially, the remote-tier buyer loses some of the capacity to help the immediate-tier buyer later. These mechanisms may explain challenges faced by remote-tier supply chain financing in practice. Managerial implications: The paper highlights the challenges faced by remote-tier financing and identifies conditions under which it can be favorable. It extends traditional finance models to incorporate supply chain considerations, demonstrating the importance of these factors in economic and financial decision making.

Yet explanations for why firms engage in such governance creation remain fragmented across a wide range of studies and disciplines. This article synthesizes existing research into a comprehensive framework that integrates macro-level institutional conditions with meso- and micro-level drivers and barriers, thereby clarifying the antecedents of corporate engagement in the creation of private governance. We also develop a research agenda addressing these gaps within debates on political corporate social responsibility (PCSR). While PCSR articulates normative ideals of legitimate corporate engagement, empirical findings show governance creation often serves instrumental reasons. Our framework clarifies why and under what conditions firms engage in the creation of private governance.",

    "abstract": "Careers in creative crafts are perceived to be precarious: workers face constant rejection and receive low and erratic pay. Yet, some creative craft workers handle these challenges better than others. Precarity sometimes subsides as careers progress, and the core-periphery structure that typifies creative craft production systems is navigable. This raises the question of how creative craft workers can cope productively with the precarity of craft work. We research a prominent creative craft worker collective: country music songwriters. Our study captures the voices of 90 creative craft workers, drawing on secondary interviews with 66 songwriters working at the core of Nashville’s highly corporatized country music production system, and 24 operating at its social and spatial periphery. We find that the key to coping with precarity lies in achieving supportive patterns of social embeddedness by investing in primary craft skills, advancing higher-order vocational skills, and navigating the core-periphery structure of the creative craft production system. As apprentice songwriters practice their craft and learn how to organize their songwriting routines, they become increasingly vested in the system. Once they become master songwriters, they broaden their networks by liaising more with other industry stakeholders and engage with the system more reflexively to ensure their continued relevance. Peripheral workers engage in allyship and develop ties with workers positioned at the system’s core. We incorporate these social strategies in a grounded theoretical model capturing how songwriters cope with precarity. We conjecture that elements of the model generalize theoretically towards other corporatized creative craft production systems.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT New ventures are expected to continuously add new jobs and managerial positions to meet the expanding demands of scaling. However, the rapid pace and inherent uncertainty of scaling often lead founders of new ventures to rely on heuristics when making these critical hiring and managerial appointment decisions. By integrating research on scaling, cognition in decision‐making, and gender stereotypes with literature on HR practices, we argue that such heuristics can exacerbate reliance on gender stereotypes rather than the actual competencies of potential candidates. Using matched employer‐employee census data covering all new ventures established and led by solo male founders in Sweden between 2004 and 2018, we find that scaling decreases the likelihood of hiring females for job positions and appointing females to managerial positions. However, the founder's HR education mitigates these negative effects on both female hiring and managerial appointments, while the founder's HR experience only mitigates the negative effects on female hiring decisions. We also tease out the invoked mechanisms, conduct post hoc tests, and run an extensive number of robustness tests.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper investigates how consulting services affect audit quality, from the perspective of knowledge- and expertise-sharing between employees. Semistructured interviews with 16 audit partners reveal that consulting expertise is used in 60–80 percent of audit engagements, with the main rationale for such collaboration being knowledge-sharing and improved audit quality. We leverage a comprehensive office-level dataset of employment profiles covering 86 percent of all employees at large U.S. public accounting firms to systematically investigate the effect of consulting employees on audit quality. We document that a one standard deviation increase in the share of consulting employees in an office results in a 2.6 percentage point reduction in restatements (a decrease of 19 percent relative to the baseline). This effect is strongest when consulting employees have skills complimentary to auditors, e.g., technical and human resources skills, and when consultants have specific industry expertise in the same industry as the audit client.

Our empirical analysis, leveraging a multisource dataset of 26,783 employees across 186 companies, substantiates this model.

    "abstract": "Abstract Spiritual leadership has become a prominent approach within the family of horizontal and non-hierarchical leadership styles, aiming to integrate employees’ spiritual needs into organizational life. While existing literature often highlights benefits such as increased well-being, cooperation, and performance, this paper critically examines the ethical and conceptual implications of spiritual leadership in for-profit contexts. It argues that current models tend to emphasize the instrumental value of spirituality, using it as a means to align employees’ motivations with organizational goals, typically centered on productivity and profitability. Building on the philosophy of Gabriel Marcel, the paper contends that spirituality and transcendence inherently resist objectification and measurement, and their integration into the workplace should preserve their depth. Two core problems are identified: the alignment problem , in which spirituality is subordinated to organizational objectives; and the conceptual problem , where reductive definitions obscure its essential qualities. Ultimately, this paper suggests abandoning the leader–follower model when considering spirituality in for-profit organizations.",

    "abstract": "Organizations emphasize specific production practices to deal with authenticity pressures, but the practices that signal authenticity to audiences must be continually adapted when production environments are unstable. Changes in the environment can make production practices suddenly infeasible, compelling organizations to perform in different ways the highly visible practices that audiences have come to associate with authenticity. However, authenticity research tends to take the continuity of production practices for granted, focusing on whether certain practices are made visible or not, and leaving unexamined how practices are made legible as they are adapted. Drawing on 16 months of ethnographic fieldwork at a renowned winery (Cal-Cru), I identify a novel form of authenticity work—trajectory normalizing work—that Cal-Cru’s production team performed internally, out of view from external audiences, to guide production changes. Specifically, the team created contrast cues to inform their actions. They avoided changes that would noticeably alter parts of production visible to audiences, or that clashed with their own understanding of authenticity. Doing so created a reassuring sense among the team that they were departing from audience expectations to sustain, not compromise, the practices that conveyed authenticity. My study highlights the backstage tensions constructing authenticity in unstable production environments.",

In this setting, unraveling and Bayesian social learning interact to produce a novel mechanism, dynamic unraveling: Unraveling that generates signals that lead to future unraveling. Applying the theory, I show how dynamic unraveling explains low-volume crashes: falls in the prices of securities on low or declining trading volume. In this context, short-selling restrictions can make low-volume crashes more likely by intensifying dynamic unraveling, but liquidity injections have the opposite effect.

We explore the nature, determinants, and consequences of SEC comment letters that refer to information disclosed in voluntary earnings conference calls. Using hand-collected data, we document that the SEC primarily references these voluntary disclosures to illustrate insufficiencies and, less commonly, inconsistencies in mandatory filings across a wide range of topics. These letters are more likely to be issued when filing reviews are more complex, SEC staff are less resource constrained, and for firms with more institutional investors and analysts. Conference call–related comments tend to occur during higher-quality review processes and require greater remediation costs than other comments. The SEC’s use of call disclosures also leads to more pronounced changes in firms’ subsequent mandatory filings, particularly when the firm indicates agreement with SEC comments. However, we observe a mixed effect on the overall information environment, consistent with possible unintended consequences for the quality of firms’ voluntary disclosures.

As a prerequisite to sustainable human community, the virtue of humanity is considered universal. It has been claimed as a ‘higher‐order virtue’, comprised of and enacted by – but irreducible to – a suite of ‘lower‐order virtues’ such as compassion and kindness. This claim is evident in widely‐adopted virtues catalogues, but we lack consensus on how humanity is defined, and which attributes qualify as its virtuous dimensions. To address this, we develop a robust definition of humanity and apply criteria distilled from virtue ethics to theorize the lower‐order virtues that comprise its virtuous dimensions. We thus determine the virtuous dimensions of humanity include empathy, compassion, forgiveness, love, kindness, and generosity. Our processual model illustrates how, when expressed by leaders and followers, these virtuous dimensions represent the fullest expression of the higher‐order virtue of humanity and sustain human community. Our systematic review details what is known empirically about each virtuous dimension of humanity in relation to leadership. Drawing on this, we propose a research agenda to advance understanding of how the virtue of humanity might enable the leadership needed today and into the future.",

    ],
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Accounting is often thought of in terms of numbers and abstract models, yet it is sustained in practice by a host of ordinary objects. This paper demonstrates how seemingly mundane items—blackboards, cue cards, flipcharts, sticky notes, envelopes, and boxes—can play quiet yet decisive roles in extending and connecting accounting into new settings. Borrowing from literature on everyday surface aesthetics, we introduce the notion of geometric mediation to denote how certain arrangements of mundane objects can draw us in, appearing so compelling that they invite us to connect the abstract logics associated with them. We illustrate this process through a study of the Logical Framework, a performance tool for nongovernmental organizations, and its transformation when adopted by a German development agency in the 1970s. Although the tool initially met resistance from an agency whose logics conflicted with the use of managerial devices, the simple materials used to operationalize the tool helped these differences feel less stark. Their shapes and arrangements made the framework look naturally compatible with other approaches, leading to a new version of the tool, known as ZOPP. Our study contributes in two ways. First, it shows how everyday aesthetics can quietly help accounting spread and adapt. Second, it offers a new view of how accounting brings together competing aspirations, not only through explicit negotiation or compromise, but also through subtle, often unnoticed material connections that make things feel “right” before they are fully thought about.",

The key empirical finding is that bilateral trade is inefficiently low in early periods of the relationship, but converges toward efficiency over time, despite sellers’ market power. Counterfactual simulations imply that both market power and enforcement contribute to inefficiencies in trade. (JEL D86, G32, K12, L14, L60, O14)",

Aggregate supply flattens under lower inflation uncertainty, higher idiosyncratic demand uncertainty, and less elastic demand. Quantitatively, our theory can rationalize the flattening of aggregate supply during the Great Moderation and steepening during the 1970s and 2020s. (JEL D21, D43, E13, E23, E31, E32)",

We show that automation targets high-rent tasks, dissipating rents, amplifying wage losses, and reducing within-group wage dispersion in exposed groups. This form of rent dissipation is inefficient and offsets the productivity gains from automation. Using US data from 1980 to 2016, we find evidence of sizable rent dissipation and reduced within-group wage dispersion due to automation. Automation accounts for 52% of the increase in between-group inequality since 1980, with rent dissipation explaining one-fifth of this total. Our estimates imply that inefficient rent dissipation has offset 60–90% of the productivity gains from automation over this period.",

For this, we develop an ecocentric ethics perspective informed by the writing of Karen Barad, in particular her notion of ‘agential cuts’. By reviewing gardening literatures, and exploring our embodied gardening practices, we attempt to ‘step out’ of institutionalised ways of thinking and working to reach for different embodied and relational ways of being with earth-others. We contribute to debates by: (a) tracing multispecies mutualities of ‘cutting-together apart’ within the gardens we tend, to show how such cutting can develop understandings of an entangled ethics in which human involvement can at times be peripheral; and, (b) showing how garden(ing)s can help enrich understandings of ‘ethico-onto-epistemologies’ by situating embodied practices of organising within planetary processes and rhythms which are variously consequential for sustaining forms of life. These contributions stemming from garden(ing)s can help to inform ecocentric thinking-being in business organisations by developing possibilities for (re)conceptualising: how businesses practices, and connected imaginaries, are entangled in creating conditions that can diminish and enhance earth-others existences; and, how the fluidities and temporalities of specifically located webs of life in which businesses activities are part necessitate sensitivities to working with unknowing.",

Patterns in entries of non‐supported versus ESO‐supported ventures, along with differences across ESO types, support our argument that primarily ecosystem‐level bridging mechanisms, such as legitimacy diffusion, knowledge spillovers, and access to relational networks, are sensitive to local conditions, whereas direct support provided by ESOs to program participants is not context‐dependent. Managerial Summary Entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial support organizations (ESOs), and ecosystem builders benefit from understanding the broader economic and entrepreneurial context. In well‐developed ecosystems, informal networks can provide access to knowledge, collaboration opportunities, and legitimacy signals, reducing the marginal contribution of additional ESO presence in the ecosystem. In less‐developed ecosystems, ESOs can support venture formation by bridging entrepreneurs to networks, partners, and markets, and by mitigating resource scarcity and the challenges of newness. Structured programs, targeted mentorship, and guidance can support venture entry across the ecosystem, complementing existing informal networks and addressing gaps where they exist. Our findings suggest that the role and potential impact of ESOs vary with local founding conditions, emphasizing the importance of aligning support mechanisms with ecosystem maturity and structural characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Research Summary Entrepreneurship accelerators are increasingly promoted as structural interventions to close gender gaps, yet studies have not established a differential impact of participation for women. This prior evidence—drawn from high‐tech, male‐dominated settings—may overlook how outcomes differ in more feminized domains such as social innovation. Using unique multi‐level data from 1417 ventures applying to 33 accelerators, we examine whether average effects conceal variation across institutional environments and program designs. We find that in more gender‐egalitarian countries, women‐led ventures performed better than peers after participating, especially in programs aiming to support women. In less egalitarian environments, however, participation offered negative or no such advantages even in gender supportive programs. These results suggest that well‐intended interventions to advance women entrepreneurs are context‐dependent and may sometimes reinforce the very disparities they intended to diminish. Managerial Summary Social innovation accelerators are often championed as a way to help women entrepreneurs thrive. But our analysis of 1417 ventures applying to 33 programs shows that results vary—and context matters. In more egalitarian countries, participation is associated with improved performance for women‐led ventures, especially when programs are explicitly designed to support them. Surprisingly, the pattern flips in less egalitarian environments: women founders who join even women‐focused programs often see no performance gains—or even declines—relative to peers. These findings suggest that well‐intentioned support can backfire if it doesn't fit the local institutional environment. For program designers and leaders, this is a call to move beyond one‐size‐fits‐all approaches and carefully align equity goals with the realities of the ecosystems they operate in.",

As they transfer and jointly create knowledge to generate common gains, differences in private benefits can arise due to asymmetric knowledge spillovers. Our model of alliance structural choices incorporates the alliance itself—the channel through which partner knowledge flows—to reflect the fact that partners and the alliance may operate in different industry contexts. We propose that partners select structural governance mechanisms (equity governance and alliance scope) to enable valuable knowledge flows while protecting themselves from unwanted spillovers. Analyzing a large sample of U.S. alliances from 1985 to 2024, we find that asymmetric distance predicts these governance choices and that it is linked to the simultaneous use of multiple structural safeguards, including equity governance and a narrow alliance scope.",

With this integrative literature review, we take stock of a fragmented body of research, based on an analysis of 647 articles across 9 disciplines. Our synthesis identifies three dominant perspectives: an organization-centric perspective that views social media as tools for strategic action; an audience-centric perspective that emphasizes audience empowerment and contestation; and a platform-centric perspective that highlights how platform features and algorithms condition organizational outcomes and audience interactions. Building on these perspectives, we develop an integrative framework of organizational enablement, audience empowerment, and platform mediation that captures how social media extend and redirect established theories. We distill five major research areas—identity and community, social evaluations, corporate social responsibility, false narratives, and organizational outcome drivers—that capture the core themes of management scholarship to date. Our analysis shows how social media distinctiveness—heightened emotionality, many-to-many diffusion, and expanded actor visibility—has generated theoretical extensions while leaving key debates unresolved. We argue that management research must better integrate across perspectives, expand attention to platform mediation, and incorporate insights from related fields. We conclude with a bold future research agenda for researchers who aim to advance theorizing on organization audience relationships in a complex media ecosystem.",

In this study, we investigate how contacts’ intra‐organizational status shapes their actions of referring entrepreneurs to their organizations for acquisition. Drawing on middle‐status conformity theory and interviews, we argue that, compared to high‐ or low‐status actors, middle‐status actors are more concerned about status loss and face a higher likelihood of such loss; therefore, they have a lower tendency to connect entrepreneurs with their organizations, resulting in a U‐shaped effect of contact status on referring actions including quantity, quality, and efficiency. Furthermore, this U‐shaped effect is moderated by organizational ownership and norms. The results based on 12,103 venture‐acquirer dyads support most of our hypotheses. Our study contributes to the entrepreneurial network literature by identifying the agency of contacts and their specific referring actions. It also adds to the network agency literature by highlighting the organizational context in which the contacts are situated as a critical enabler or inhibitor of such agency. In addition, it enriches the mergers and acquisitions literature by revealing the roles of actors at various organizational levels in facilitating corporate engagement with new ventures.",

    "abstract": "How should firms best communicate their corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts? Across seven preregistered studies (two large field studies and five online lab experiments), we find that making a series of periodic contributions, e.g., donating $20,000 per month for 12 months, rather than donating an equivalent aggregate amount, e.g., donating $240,000 in a year, improves outcomes for donor companies such as reputation, customer engagement, and purchase likelihood. The benefits of periodic donations arise primarily due to heightened judgments of the donor’s authentic prosocial motivation, which affects outcomes in two ways. Via one process pathway, the consistency of periodic donations increases judgments that the donor gave due to authentic prosocial motives, which then increases favorable donor evaluations. Via a second process pathway, heightened judgments of the donor’s authentic prosocial motivation also increase the perceived impact of the donation, further boosting favorable donor evaluations. Additional studies demonstrate when and why periodic donations may benefit, or in some cases even harm, evaluations of the donor. Taken together, this research highlights consumers’ sensitivity to cues of consistency, and the importance of perceived authentic prosocial motivation, when consumers grant charitable credit in CSR.",

These technologies democratize content creation, enabling inexperienced individuals to generate content that rivals the quality produced by professionals. This paper adopts a game-theoretic model to study how the democratization of content creation affects welfare. While the content-democratization technology can assist low-quality creators in improving their content quality, it can precipitate a flood of such content in the market and crowd out high-quality content production, leading to welfare losses. An incremental technology development with low reduction in quality gap can hurt individual consumers and all creators, leading to a lose-lose market outcome. In contrast, a drastic one with high reduction in quality gap benefits individual consumers and all creators, leading to a win-win outcome. Furthermore, when platforms can more effectively screen content and promote high-quality content, welfare rises but the technology is more likely to reduce welfare. The findings help explain the distinct impacts of content democratization in different industries.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We study the implications of inflation heterogeneity for individuals and firms through the lens of accounting research, applying measurement frameworks to the national accounting measurement of inflation. We first examine the systematic exposure of individuals in low‐income households to higher inflation relative to those in high‐income households. We show that this “inflation gap” is linked with future rising inequality in the form of widening gaps in healthcare insurance, education, homeownership, and credit card debt, as well as in a higher frequency of property crimes. We also provide an economic mechanism connecting the inflation gap with rising inequality, empirically demonstrating the role of basic goods in reducing the ability of individuals in the low‐income group to attain the social and economic implications that we study. In addition, we show a channel that connects the inflation gap to firms' profitability. Indeed, consistent with the inflation gap disadvantaging low‐income households mainly through basic goods, the inflation gap fluctuations are especially strongly connected to the profitability of firms operating in the energy and consumer staples sectors. Finally, we find that market power plays a role in this connection, where this link is even stronger for firms with high market power. Taking its findings together, the paper shows that differential inflation pressures have major implications for household well‐being and corporate profitability.",

Linked regulation allows inspectors who uncover violations at one plant to increase future enforcement at other plants that share a common owner. When compliance costs are correlated, regulators can then target scarce enforcement resources towards bad actors without inspecting everyone. We develop an empirical framework of dynamic moral hazard under linked regulation that allows for large portfolios of plants and for choices to be interdependent within the portfolio of plants and across time. Using the framework we evaluate a linked regulation scheme in Texas and find that linked regulation performs substantially better than both unlinked regulation and untargeted regulation. We test two alternative theoretical mechanisms that underpin the benefit—a “firm-wide moral hazard mechanism” and a “correlated targeting mechanism”—and find that a large share of the value of linked regulation is due to the former.",

    "abstract": "We study multi-period risk-averse inventory control in a data-driven setting. In this problem, a risk-averse retailer makes periodic decisions on inventory levels based only on historical demand observations without full knowledge of the demand distribution. We adopt the popular nested formulation for risk-averse programs to formulate this multi-period problem and its data-driven counterpart under a coherent risk measure. Our objective is to study the sample complexity bound such that with high probability, the data-driven policy is near-optimal, i.e., the relative error of risk under the data-driven policy compared with the optimal risk is arbitrarily small. Analysis of this problem is inherently challenging, because the multi-period nature requires solving the risk-averse program and its data-driven version recursively backward in time, while the (empirical) risk-to-go functions in this process do not have closed-form derivatives for most risk measures, which renders existing first-order methods for the risk-neutral newsvendor model invalid. In this study, we develop a zeroth-order framework to establish the complexity bound on sample sizes to guarantee nearoptimality of the data-driven policy with given accuracy levels. Instead of using first-order derivative information on the risk-to-go function, our analysis directly examines the class of functions that underpins each cumulative risk function and derives maximum inequalities for this functional class by computing the covering numbers. Finite-sample complexity bounds are then used to establish asymptotic properties of the estimated risk, including consistency and convergence rate. Computationally, the time complexity for solving the data-driven policy, which is essentially an empirical dynamic programming (EDP) estimator of the optimal policy, increases exponentially in the length of the planning horizon. To speed up computation, we propose an approximation scheme that recursively approximates the empirical cumulative risk function with a convex piecewise linear function and then minimize it to obtain a modified data-driven inventory policy. We show that with proper control for approximation error, the modified data-driven policy is also near-optimal, and it has the same order of sample complexity bound as that for the original EDP policy.",

    ],
    "abstract": "In the presence of supplier quality risk, offering suppliers a higher procurement price or increasing inspection effort are two approaches to motivate a supplier to invest in higher quality. In this paper, we consider three sourcing and inspection strategies for a brand with two branch shops facing supplier quality risk: joint, mixed, and independent strategies. Under the joint strategy, the brand jointly sources for its two shops by offering a uniform procurement price and inspects for both shops in a centralized way (joint sourcing and joint inspection). Under the mixed strategy, the brand jointly sources for its two shops by offering a procurement price and then each shop decides its own inspection probability (joint sourcing and independent inspection). Under the independent strategy, each shop decides its own procurement price and inspection probability (independent sourcing and independent inspection).We find that among the three strategies, the joint strategy mostly relies on the inspection tool to motivate supplier’s high-quality effort, and the mixed strategy mainly utilizes the procurement price tool by offering the highest price for supplier’s high quality.We further find that, no matter the brand is purely profit driven or cares about the quantity of low-quality products sold to the market, the mixed strategy is always preferred to independent strategy. The preference between mixed and joint strategies is jointly determined by the fixed cost incurred in joint sourcing and inspection accuracy. For intermediate fixed cost, if the inspection accuracy is sufficiently high, the mixed strategy is preferred to joint strategy; otherwise, the joint strategy is preferred to the mixed strategy. Interestingly, when a brand becomes more socially responsible (i.e., it cares more about the quantity of lowquality products sold to the market), it may switch from a reliable supplier to a risky supplier, leading to more low-quality products sold to the market. This is because with a greater level of social responsibility, the brand’s higher inspection efforts become more credible, which motivates the risky supplier’s higher quality effort.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology holds promise for improving access to financing within supply chains, especially for small and under-financed suppliers. Yet, the specific ways in which blockchain technology mitigates financing frictions and the features that contribute to successful platform implementations remain unclear. Following a theory elaboration approach, we close that gap by studying which financing frictions the BCF solutions aim to address, which blockchain features they use, and the association between the frictions and features. In our analysis, we examine 312 documents with unstructured text describing 11 BCF solutions, both successful and failed. Using AI-based large language models, we identify patterns connecting seven types of financing frictions and three key blockchain features. We find that the transactional friction is the most prominent, despite receiving limited attention in the academic literature, while bankruptcy costs and taxes—frictions that are commonly discussed in the literature—are rarely associated with blockchain features in our sample. Among blockchain features, tokenization is used sparingly; and, unlike other features, it appears in successful BCF solutions only. Moreover, connections between frictions and features are not random: while transactional and hidden actions frictions are linked to all three blockchain features, other frictions are typically associated with only one. Our findings offer a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which blockchain adds value in supply chain finance, suggesting that aligning blockchain features with specific frictions may enhance the chances of success. We also demonstrate a method for using AI to evaluate large amounts of unstructured data in operations management research.",
