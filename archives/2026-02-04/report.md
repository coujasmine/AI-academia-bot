## Entrepreneurship

### 1. [Ecosystem conditions and the efficacy of entrepreneurial support organizations: Moderating effects on venture entry](https://doi.org/10.1002/sej.70015)

> Abstract Research Summary Using a panel of 2688 city‐year observations of German fintech ventures and entrepreneurial support organizations (ESOs), we examine how ESO presence relates to venture entry. We argue and demonstrate that this relationship is contingent on local founding conditions. We find that ESO presence is most strongly associated with entry in thin ecosystems, while this association weakens in more active and developed contexts. Patterns in entries of non‐supported versus ESO‐supported ventures, along with differences across ESO types, support our argument that primarily ecosystem‐level bridging mechanisms, such as legitimacy diffusion, knowledge spillovers, and access to relational networks, are sensitive to local conditions, whereas direct support provided by ESOs to prog...

`FT50` `Innovation-Core`

> Abstract Research Summary Entrepreneurs use strategic framing to gain support for their novel ventures, products, and services. A key challenge entrepreneurs face is that audiences often contest frames that introduce novel ideas, especially when these ideas disrupt audiences' mental and business models. Such contestation can hinder novel ideas from being accepted, a risk that is amplified when entrepreneurs face contestation from multiple audiences. We lack understanding, however, of how contestation from multiple audiences shapes the strategic framing of novel ideas. We study this question at Tony's Chocolonely, a social enterprise that faced such contestation when introducing “slave‐free” chocolate. By showing how the social enterprise reacted to contestation from multiple audiences in d...

### 1. [When Opposites Don’t Attract: The New Information Environment, Polarization, and What Happens to Social Evaluations When ‘The World Goes to Hell in a Handbasket’](https://doi.org/10.1111/joms.70067)

**Authors:** Timothy G. Pollock, Violina P. Rindova

**Journal:** Journal of Management Studies (JMS) | **Published:** 2026-01-31

`FT50` `Innovation-Core`

> Abstract Organizations today operate in a new information environment, where changing technologies have enabled fundamentally different forms and pathways of information creation and dissemination while also generating unintended consequences – chief among them increased polarization. In combination, the new information environment and polarization have profoundly altered the social processes underpinning social evaluations. To animate social evaluations research on these issues, we consider how information environment shifts and increased polarization affect the value and durability of five social evaluation types – legitimacy, reputation, status, celebrity/infamy, and stigma/esteem. We highlight the implications for both theorizing about and empirically studying social evaluations in an ...

**Authors:** Toby Newstead, Saeed Loghman, Alexander Newman, Ronald E. Riggio

**Journal:** Journal of Management Studies (JMS) | **Published:** 2026-01-30

`FT50` `Innovation-Core`

> Abstract Humanity – the virtue enabling meaningful human connection – is vital to the leadership we need to survive our polycrisis context. As a prerequisite to sustainable human community, the virtue of humanity is considered universal. It has been claimed as a ‘higher‐order virtue’, comprised of and enacted by – but irreducible to – a suite of ‘lower‐order virtues’ such as compassion and kindness. This claim is evident in widely‐adopted virtues catalogues, but we lack consensus on how humanity is defined, and which attributes qualify as its virtuous dimensions. To address this, we develop a robust definition of humanity and apply criteria distilled from virtue ethics to theorize the lower‐order virtues that comprise its virtuous dimensions. We thus determine the virtuous dimensions of hu...

### 4. [Structural Choices at Alliance Formation: Accounting for Partner Asymmetry in Industry Distance](https://doi.org/10.1177/01492063251410193)

**Authors:** Sergio Grove, Brian C. Fox, Rebecca Ranucci, Manjot S. Bhussar, David Souder

`FT50` `Innovation-Core`

> Parties in an alliance aim to capture both common and private benefits. As they transfer and jointly create knowledge to generate common gains, differences in private benefits can arise due to asymmetric knowledge spillovers. Our model of alliance structural choices incorporates the alliance itself—the channel through which partner knowledge flows—to reflect the fact that partners and the alliance may operate in different industry contexts. We propose that partners select structural governance mechanisms (equity governance and alliance scope) to enable valuable knowledge flows while protecting themselves from unwanted spillovers. Analyzing a large sample of U.S. alliances from 1985 to 2024, we find that asymmetric distance predicts these governance choices and that it is linked to the simu...

> Social media have fundamentally reshaped how organizations and audiences interact, challenging theoretical assumptions in the management literature. With this integrative literature review, we take stock of a fragmented body of research, based on an analysis of 647 articles across 9 disciplines. Our synthesis identifies three dominant perspectives: an organization-centric perspective that views social media as tools for strategic action; an audience-centric perspective that emphasizes audience empowerment and contestation; and a platform-centric perspective that highlights how platform features and algorithms condition organizational outcomes and audience interactions. Building on these perspectives, we develop an integrative framework of organizational enablement, audience empowerment, an...

### 6. [Whom Should Entrepreneurs Approach? The Effect of Contact Status on Referring New Ventures for Acquisition](https://doi.org/10.1111/joms.70061)

**Authors:** Xi Chen, Jiaosha Chen, Jin Chen, Ruining Cao

**Journal:** Journal of Management Studies (JMS) | **Published:** 2026-01-29 | **Open Access**

`FT50` `Innovation-Core`

> Abstract Prior entrepreneurial network literature has primarily examined how entrepreneurs’ networking efforts facilitate interorganizational exchanges, while giving little attention to the agency of their contacts. In this study, we investigate how contacts’ intra‐organizational status shapes their actions of referring entrepreneurs to their organizations for acquisition. Drawing on middle‐status conformity theory and interviews, we argue that, compared to high‐ or low‐status actors, middle‐status actors are more concerned about status loss and face a higher likelihood of such loss; therefore, they have a lower tendency to connect entrepreneurs with their organizations, resulting in a U‐shaped effect of contact status on referring actions including quantity, quality, and efficiency. Furth...

### 7. [The Ebbs and Flows of Reputation as Meaningful Signals: Market Reactions to Firms’ Reputation Instability](https://doi.org/10.1111/joms.70068)

**Authors:** Huy Nguyen, Rui Jiang, Zhiang Lin

**Journal:** Journal of Management Studies (JMS) | **Published:** 2026-01-28 | **Open Access**

`FT50` `Innovation-Core`

> Abstract While prior studies typically treat firm reputation as a stable, intangible resource reflecting cumulative competence, we extend a socio‐constructionist perspective by shifting the focus to reputation instability – erratic fluctuations in a firm’s reputation over time relative to its industry peers. We argue that reputation instability functions as a distinct and often overlooked market signal by introducing ambiguities that influence investor valuation of a firm in a stock market context. Crucially, the impact of reputation instability is further shaped by contextual cues that anchor investor expectations. A firm’s current reputation and industry dynamism condition how instability may be regarded, either as a warning sign or a potential indication of improvement. Using panel data...

### 1. [Overcoming barriers? The mixed results of social innovation accelerator programs for women entrepreneurs](https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.70064)

**Authors:** Nilanjana Dutt, Sarah Kaplan

**Journal:** Strategic Management Journal (SMJ) | **Published:** 2026-01-29 | **Open Access**

`FT50` `UTD24` `Innovation-Core`

> Abstract Research Summary Entrepreneurship accelerators are increasingly promoted as structural interventions to close gender gaps, yet studies have not established a differential impact of participation for women. This prior evidence—drawn from high‐tech, male‐dominated settings—may overlook how outcomes differ in more feminized domains such as social innovation. Using unique multi‐level data from 1417 ventures applying to 33 accelerators, we examine whether average effects conceal variation across institutional environments and program designs. We find that in more gender‐egalitarian countries, women‐led ventures performed better than peers after participating, especially in programs aiming to support women. In less egalitarian environments, however, participation offered negative or no ...

## Organization

### 1. [Trajectory Normalizing Work in Unstable Production Environments: When Adapting Production Means Appearing Authentic](https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19496)

**Authors:** Alan Zhang

**Journal:** Organization Science (OrgSci) | **Published:** 2026-01-30

`FT50` `UTD24` `Innovation-Core`

> Organizations emphasize specific production practices to deal with authenticity pressures, but the practices that signal authenticity to audiences must be continually adapted when production environments are unstable. Changes in the environment can make production practices suddenly infeasible, compelling organizations to perform in different ways the highly visible practices that audiences have come to associate with authenticity. However, authenticity research tends to take the continuity of production practices for granted, focusing on whether certain practices are made visible or not, and leaving unexamined how practices are made legible as they are adapted. Drawing on 16 months of ethnographic fieldwork at a renowned winery (Cal-Cru), I identify a novel form of authenticity work—traje...

### 1. [Dynamic Unraveling](https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02412)

**Authors:** Joel Flynn

**Journal:** Management Science (MS) | **Published:** 2026-01-30

`FT50` `UTD24` `Innovation-Related`

> This paper studies price and liquidity dynamics in the presence of costly short-selling when uninformed traders have limited willingness-to-pay to trade securities. In this setting, unraveling and Bayesian social learning interact to produce a novel mechanism, dynamic unraveling: Unraveling that generates signals that lead to future unraveling. Applying the theory, I show how dynamic unraveling explains low-volume crashes: falls in the prices of securities on low or declining trading volume. In this context, short-selling restrictions can make low-volume crashes more likely by intensifying dynamic unraveling, but liquidity injections have the opposite effect.

`FT50` `UTD24` `Innovation-Related`

> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reviews firms’ financial reports and issues comment letters to ensure compliance with applicable disclosure and accounting requirements. We explore the nature, determinants, and consequences of SEC comment letters that refer to information disclosed in voluntary earnings conference calls. Using hand-collected data, we document that the SEC primarily references these voluntary disclosures to illustrate insufficiencies and, less commonly, inconsistencies in mandatory filings across a wide range of topics. These letters are more likely to be issued when filing reviews are more complex, SEC staff are less resource constrained, and for firms with more institutional investors and analysts. Conference call–related comments tend to occur during higher-q...

`FT50` `UTD24` `Innovation-Related`

> Abstract Managers’ identities in large matrixed MNE structures are complex and pliable. While research has examined the identities of individual actors located in headquarters (HQ) or local subsidiaries, the unique identity challenges faced by those operating outside these conventional units are less predictable. Our study explores how managers experience and manage a ‘liminal identity’—feeling ‘betwixt and between’ multiple identity positions. Focusing on US MNEs in the life sciences sector, we interviewed managers who assumed global responsibilities from corporate HQ while remaining situated in their local (Irish) subsidiary. We find that operating between corporate HQ, a global network, and the local subsidiary forged a liminal identity. Straddling this local–corporate–global nexus was ...

**Journal:** Journal of Marketing Research (JMR) | **Published:** 2026-01-29

`FT50` `UTD24`

> How should firms best communicate their corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts? Across seven preregistered studies (two large field studies and five online lab experiments), we find that making a series of periodic contributions, e.g., donating $20,000 per month for 12 months, rather than donating an equivalent aggregate amount, e.g., donating $240,000 in a year, improves outcomes for donor companies such as reputation, customer engagement, and purchase likelihood. The benefits of periodic donations arise primarily due to heightened judgments of the donor’s authentic prosocial motivation, which affects outcomes in two ways. Via one process pathway, the consistency of periodic donations increases judgments that the donor gave due to authentic prosocial motives, which then increases f...

### 2. [EXPRESS: Welfare Implications of Democratization in Content Creation: Generative AI and Beyond](https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437261423540)

**Authors:** Tianxin Zou, Zijun Shi, Yue Wu

**Journal:** Journal of Marketing Research (JMR) | **Published:** 2026-01-29

`FT50` `UTD24`

> The rise of content-creation technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) has reshaped the way people produce and consume content. These technologies democratize content creation, enabling inexperienced individuals to generate content that rivals the quality produced by professionals. This paper adopts a game-theoretic model to study how the democratization of content creation affects welfare. While the content-democratization technology can assist low-quality creators in improving their content quality, it can precipitate a flood of such content in the market and crowd out high-quality content production, leading to welfare losses. An incremental technology development with low reduction in quality gap can hurt individual consumers and all creators, leading to a lose-l...

### 3. [From decision patience to process patience: A decision–process integration of the choice to wait and the experience of waiting](https://doi.org/10.1002/jcpy.70016)

**Authors:** Selin A. Malkoc

**Journal:** Journal of Consumer Psychology (JCP) | **Published:** 2026-01-28 | **Open Access**

`FT50`

> Abstract Consumer impatience has long been examined through the lens of intertemporal choice, where patience is inferred from decisions to accept delayed rewards. Yet, this conceptualization captures only the choice to wait, not the experience of waiting. Sweeny's Process Model of Patience (PMP) shifts the focus from temporal preferences to temporal affect, defining impatience as a negatively valenced emotional response to objectionable delays and patience as the active regulation of this emotion. In this commentary, I bridge these two traditions by mapping the psychological drivers of intertemporal choice—affective urges, cognitive representations, construal, subjective time perception, and future‐self connectedness—onto the mechanisms that shape waiting experiences. This decision–process...

**Authors:** Yaqi Li, Guangxin Jiang, Ying Zhong

**Journal:** INFORMS journal on computing (IJOC) | **Published:** 2026-01-28

`UTD24`

> We introduce Python Parallel Ranking and Selection (PyPRS), a Python software package specifically developed to solve large-scale ranking and selection problems in parallel computing environments. The underlying parallel computing framework is Ray. PyPRS incorporates four well-known parallel procedures: the good selection procedure, the parallel adaptive survivor selection procedure, the knockout-tournament procedure, and the fixed-budget knockout-tournament procedure. The key features of PyPRS include (i) a modular structure that facilitates easy extension, enhancement, and customization of procedures; (ii) a plug-and-play functionality that enables easy applications of both built-in and custom procedures to various problems; and (iii) an intuitive graphical user interface that improves u...

**Journal:** Production and Operations Management (POM) | **Published:** 2026-01-29

`FT50` `UTD24`

> We study multi-period risk-averse inventory control in a data-driven setting. In this problem, a risk-averse retailer makes periodic decisions on inventory levels based only on historical demand observations without full knowledge of the demand distribution. We adopt the popular nested formulation for risk-averse programs to formulate this multi-period problem and its data-driven counterpart under a coherent risk measure. Our objective is to study the sample complexity bound such that with high probability, the data-driven policy is near-optimal, i.e., the relative error of risk under the data-driven policy compared with the optimal risk is arbitrarily small. Analysis of this problem is inherently challenging, because the multi-period nature requires solving the risk-averse program and its...

`FT50` `UTD24`

> In the presence of supplier quality risk, offering suppliers a higher procurement price or increasing inspection effort are two approaches to motivate a supplier to invest in higher quality. In this paper, we consider three sourcing and inspection strategies for a brand with two branch shops facing supplier quality risk: joint, mixed, and independent strategies. Under the joint strategy, the brand jointly sources for its two shops by offering a uniform procurement price and inspects for both shops in a centralized way (joint sourcing and joint inspection). Under the mixed strategy, the brand jointly sources for its two shops by offering a procurement price and then each shop decides its own inspection probability (joint sourcing and independent inspection). Under the independent strategy, ...

`FT50` `UTD24`

> Blockchain technology holds promise for improving access to financing within supply chains, especially for small and under-financed suppliers. Yet, the specific ways in which blockchain technology mitigates financing frictions and the features that contribute to successful platform implementations remain unclear. Following a theory elaboration approach, we close that gap by studying which financing frictions the BCF solutions aim to address, which blockchain features they use, and the association between the frictions and features. In our analysis, we examine 312 documents with unstructured text describing 11 BCF solutions, both successful and failed. Using AI-based large language models, we identify patterns connecting seven types of financing frictions and three key blockchain features. ...

`FT50` `UTD24`

> Stream SGD: Fast Learning and Valid Inference from Dependent Data Many online optimization problems in operations research rely on data generated by Markovian systems whose dynamics depend on the decision parameters, creating both statistical dependence and biased gradient information. This paper, “Convergence and Inference of Stream Stochastic Gradient Descent, with Applications to Queueing Systems and Inventory Control,” develops a unified theory for stream stochastic gradient descent (SGD), a sample-efficient method that uses just one observation per iteration. Using Poisson-equation techniques, the authors quantify and control gradient bias and dependence, proving an optimal [Formula: see text] convergence rate and a state-of-the-art O(log T) regret bound. Beyond optimization performan...

**Authors:** Leon Barton, Marvin Neu, Amanda Shantz, Heike Bruch

**Journal:** Human Relations (HR) | **Published:** 2026-01-31 | **Open Access**

`FT50`

> This study investigates how disparities in access to telework arrangements within organizations influence collective outcomes. By incorporating social identity with justice theories, we develop a conceptual model and hypothesize that greater dispersion in organizational telework access correlates with diminished organizational performance, primarily due to its association with lower collective positive affective tone. However, we argue that collective organizational identification can mitigate this negative impact. Our empirical analysis, leveraging a multisource dataset of 26,783 employees across 186 companies, substantiates this model. These findings advocate for the importance of intra-organizational variation of telework access in enriching our understanding of both the advantages and ...

### 1. [The Tacit Pull of Fit: Accounting’s Mundane Objects and the Everyday Aesthetics of Mediation](https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.70030)

**Authors:** David Crvelin, Daniel Martinez

**Journal:** Contemporary Accounting Research (CAR) | **Published:** 2026-01-30

`FT50`

> ABSTRACT Accounting is often thought of in terms of numbers and abstract models, yet it is sustained in practice by a host of ordinary objects. This paper demonstrates how seemingly mundane items—blackboards, cue cards, flipcharts, sticky notes, envelopes, and boxes—can play quiet yet decisive roles in extending and connecting accounting into new settings. Borrowing from literature on everyday surface aesthetics, we introduce the notion of geometric mediation to denote how certain arrangements of mundane objects can draw us in, appearing so compelling that they invite us to connect the abstract logics associated with them. We illustrate this process through a study of the Logical Framework, a performance tool for nongovernmental organizations, and its transformation when adopted by a Germa...

> ABSTRACT We study the implications of inflation heterogeneity for individuals and firms through the lens of accounting research, applying measurement frameworks to the national accounting measurement of inflation. We first examine the systematic exposure of individuals in low‐income households to higher inflation relative to those in high‐income households. We show that this “inflation gap” is linked with future rising inequality in the form of widening gaps in healthcare insurance, education, homeownership, and credit card debt, as well as in a higher frequency of property crimes. We also provide an economic mechanism connecting the inflation gap with rising inequality, empirically demonstrating the role of basic goods in reducing the ability of individuals in the low‐income group to atta...

> ABSTRACT Accounting firms have traditionally operated as both elite and reinventive institutions that offer a structured and prestigious career path and enforce a deeply transformative socialization process for auditors. However, recent labor market shifts and evolving work preferences are challenging this regime of power, with significant implications for firms and their employees. Drawing on 31 semistructured interviews with auditors in Canada, our study examines how these changes are reshaping power dynamics within accounting firms. First, we find that firms are increasingly struggling to define and produce the ideal auditor. Instead, as we highlight, they are experiencing the emergence of the default auditor , a professional shaped more by labor market constraints and transactional eng...

> We assess whether men and women are treated differently when presenting their economics research. We collected data across thousands of seminars, job market talks, and conference presentations, leveraging human judgment and audio-processing algorithms to measure the number, tone, and type of interruptions. Within a seminar series, women are interrupted more than men. This holds when controlling for characteristics of the presenter, paper, and audience. Interruptions that are negative in tenor or tone or cut off the presenter mid-sentence increase for women presenters. We also find greater engagement of female audience members with female presenters, suggesting a potential role model effect. (JEL A11, C45, J16, J44)

> We show remote work led to large drops in lease revenues, occupancy, and market rents in the commercial office sector. We revalue New York City office buildings, taking into account both the cash flow and discount rate implications of these shocks, and find a 46 percent decline in long-run value. For all US office markets combined, we find a $556.8 billion value destruction. Higher-quality buildings were buffered against these trends due to a flight to quality, while lower-quality offices are at risk of becoming a stranded asset. These valuation changes have repercussions for financial stability and local public finances. (JEL E31, E32, G12, J22, M51, R33)

> This paper studies the efficiency of self-enforced relational agreements, a common solution to contracting frictions, when sellers have market power and contracts cannot be externally enforced. To this end, I develop a dynamic contracting model with limited enforcement in which buyers can default on their trade credit debt and estimate it using a novel dataset from the Ecuadorian manufacturing supply chain. The key empirical finding is that bilateral trade is inefficiently low in early periods of the relationship, but converges toward efficiency over time, despite sellers’ market power. Counterfactual simulations imply that both market power and enforcement contribute to inefficiencies in trade. (JEL D86, G32, K12, L14, L60, O14)

> We argue that consumer credit spreads matter for household choices and that time-varying spreads have important distributional consequences. Studying Danish household data, we show that consumer credit spreads have heterogeneous impact on asset dynamics and consumption choices across the wealth distribution and that time-varying spreads induce a countercyclical marginal propensity to consume. We study a HANK model where banks provide consumer credit and corporate loans. Through countercyclical credit spreads, frictional finance amplifies aggregate shocks and induces consumption inequality. Economies with less leveraged banks experience reduced aggregate volatility but may face higher volatility and lower welfare at the household level. (JEL D12, D31, E12, E21, E32, E52, G51)

> Captive finance subsidiaries create a channel for trade policy to affect consumer credit. Examining the impact of the Trump administration’s metal tariffs on captive automobile lenders, we find that consumers received higher interest rates from captive lenders after the tariffs relative to unaffected noncaptive lenders. Further, we document a disparate impact on low-income borrowers and in areas with less lending competition. Our results suggest that tariffs may impact not only the price of goods but also the financing terms of purchases. Thus, focusing solely on directly affected product prices may underestimate tariff pass-through significantly. (JEL F13, F14, G21, L22, L61, L62)

> We study the effects of intensifying competition for contracts in the context of US Defense procurement. Leveraging a discontinuous regulation that mandates agencies to publicize certain contract opportunities, we document that expanding the set of bidders reduces award prices but deteriorates post-award performance in terms of cost overruns and delays. We develop and estimate an auction model with endogenous entry and stochastic execution performance, in which the buyer endogenously chooses the intensity of competition. Model estimates indicate substantial heterogeneity in performance across contractors and show that simple adjustments to the current regulation could provide significant savings in procurement spending.

> This paper estimates the effects of improving public transit infrastructure on city structure and welfare. It develops a quantitative urban model with multiple worker groups and transit modes, and derives a special case yielding sufficient statistics for aggregate welfare in a broad class of models. The paper estimates reduced-form elasticities to implement the approach using data spanning construction of the world’s largest Bus Rapid Transit system in Bogotá, Colombia. This class of models explains observed adjustments in economic activity. Standard value-of-time calculations capture only 52 percent of welfare gains. Accounting for reallocation and general equilibrium effects, distributional impacts are modest. (JEL H76, L92, L98, O18, R42, R53)

> Modern theories of aggregate supply are built on the foundation that firms set prices and commit to producing whatever the market demands. We remove this strategic restriction and allow firms to choose supply functions, mappings that describe the prices charged at each quantity of production. Theoretically, we characterize firms’ optimal supply function choices in general equilibrium and study the resulting implications for aggregate supply. Aggregate supply flattens under lower inflation uncertainty, higher idiosyncratic demand uncertainty, and less elastic demand. Quantitatively, our theory can rationalize the flattening of aggregate supply during the Great Moderation and steepening during the 1970s and 2020s. (JEL D21, D43, E13, E23, E31, E32)

> We show that subjective assessments of employee “potential” contribute to gender gaps in promotion and pay. Using data on 29,809 management-track employees from a large retail chain, we find that women receive substantially lower potential ratings despite receiving higher performance ratings. Differences in potential ratings account for approximately half of the gender promotion gap. Women’s lower potential ratings do not reflect accurate forecasts of future performance: Women subsequently outperform male colleagues, both on average and on the margin of promotion. We highlight two mechanisms driving the gender potential gap: strategic retention and stereotyping. (JEL J16, J31, J71, L81, M12, M51)

> Principal-agent problems often extend beyond what can be directly addressed through conventional incentive arrangements. We examine a context where physicians are likely under-incentivized to minimize total medical costs until their private financial interests align with those of patients. Leveraging novel data on physician ownership of ambulatory surgery centers——that is, same-day facilities——we show that these equity holdings cause a substitution away from higher cost, rival settings that lowers Medicare spending by 10–40 percent per physician. We find no clear evidence of perverse behavior following these investments. Instead, our findings demonstrate how entrepreneurial activity can indirectly limit principal-agent problems and improve efficiency. (JEL D82, D91, G51, I11, I18, L84)

> Abstract This paper studies the effects of automation in a task-based economy in which some jobs pay workers rents—wages above their outside option. We show that automation targets high-rent tasks, dissipating rents, amplifying wage losses, and reducing within-group wage dispersion in exposed groups. This form of rent dissipation is inefficient and offsets the productivity gains from automation. Using US data from 1980 to 2016, we find evidence of sizable rent dissipation and reduced within-group wage dispersion due to automation. Automation accounts for 52% of the increase in between-group inequality since 1980, with rent dissipation explaining one-fifth of this total. Our estimates imply that inefficient rent dissipation has offset 60–90% of the productivity gains from automation over th...

> Abstract We evaluate the efficiency of dynamic linked environmental regulation. Linked regulation allows inspectors who uncover violations at one plant to increase future enforcement at other plants that share a common owner. When compliance costs are correlated, regulators can then target scarce enforcement resources towards bad actors without inspecting everyone. We develop an empirical framework of dynamic moral hazard under linked regulation that allows for large portfolios of plants and for choices to be interdependent within the portfolio of plants and across time. Using the framework we evaluate a linked regulation scheme in Texas and find that linked regulation performs substantially better than both unlinked regulation and untargeted regulation. We test two alternative theoretical...

> Abstract We develop a model that integrates modern theories of labor market flows with nominal wage rigidities to study the consequences of inflation on the labor market. Nominal wage stickiness incentivizes workers to engage in job-to-job transitions after an unexpected increase in the price level. Such dynamics lead to a rise in aggregate vacancies associating a seemingly tight labor market with lower real wages—two facts observed during the recent inflation period. The calibrated model jointly matches aggregate and cross-sectional trends in worker flows and wages during the 2021-2024 period. Using historical data, we show that prior periods of high inflation were also associated with increasing vacancies and upward shifts in the Beveridge curve. Our results suggest that policymakers and...

> Abstract Spiritual leadership has become a prominent approach within the family of horizontal and non-hierarchical leadership styles, aiming to integrate employees’ spiritual needs into organizational life. While existing literature often highlights benefits such as increased well-being, cooperation, and performance, this paper critically examines the ethical and conceptual implications of spiritual leadership in for-profit contexts. It argues that current models tend to emphasize the instrumental value of spirituality, using it as a means to align employees’ motivations with organizational goals, typically centered on productivity and profitability. Building on the philosophy of Gabriel Marcel, the paper contends that spirituality and transcendence inherently resist objectification and me...

> Abstract In this paper, we turn to gardens to offer a new ethics of being with the world that can inform sustainable organising. For this, we develop an ecocentric ethics perspective informed by the writing of Karen Barad, in particular her notion of ‘agential cuts’. By reviewing gardening literatures, and exploring our embodied gardening practices, we attempt to ‘step out’ of institutionalised ways of thinking and working to reach for different embodied and relational ways of being with earth-others. We contribute to debates by: (a) tracing multispecies mutualities of ‘cutting-together apart’ within the gardens we tend, to show how such cutting can develop understandings of an entangled ethics in which human involvement can at times be peripheral; and, (b) showing how garden(ing)s can hel...
