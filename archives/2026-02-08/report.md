### 2. [The power of expressed humility: Early stage investors' reaction to humble entrepreneurs](https://doi.org/10.1002/sej.70016)

**Authors:** Laurent Vilanova, Ivana Vitanova

`FT50` `Innovation-Core`

> Abstract Research Summary We examine how entrepreneur‐expressed humility affects early stage investors' willingness to fund new ventures. In pitching contexts where investors rely on relational cues and implicit prototypes of entrepreneurs, we theorize three distinct pathways through which expressed humility shapes funding decisions. First, building on research regarding interpersonal signals in early stage valuation, we propose that humility fosters perceptions of interpersonal affect and trust and team‐building qualities, increasing investors' willingness to fund. Second, drawing on implicit leadership theories, we argue that humility may trigger negative perceptions regarding the entrepreneur's ability to make rapid and risky decisions. Across a videometric analysis of 140 real‐world pi...

### 1. [Network‐Enabled Responses to Deglobalization: Examining How Firms Strategize During Eras of Global Disruption](https://doi.org/10.1111/joms.70066)

**Authors:** Emily Buchnea, Nicholas D. Wong

> Abstract Recent research has shown how cycles of globalization and deglobalization can disrupt firms and networks. Understanding this process requires a historical perspective on how firms and networks coordinate, strategize, and respond to the effects of deglobalization. This paper examines firm‐level, network‐enabled strategic responses to deglobalization by analysing a selection of key firms operating within the Liverpool (UK) and New York (USA) networks at the turn of the nineteenth century. The case study analyses firms within a broader network structure through network visualization, supplemented by various archival data sources. We explore the strategic responses of multiple firms and demonstrate how the network supported them, enabling them to address the challenges posed by deglob...

> Careers in creative crafts are perceived to be precarious: workers face constant rejection and receive low and erratic pay. Yet, some creative craft workers handle these challenges better than others. Precarity sometimes subsides as careers progress, and the core-periphery structure that typifies creative craft production systems is navigable. This raises the question of how creative craft workers can cope productively with the precarity of craft work. We research a prominent creative craft worker collective: country music songwriters. Our study captures the voices of 90 creative craft workers, drawing on secondary interviews with 66 songwriters working at the core of Nashville’s highly corporatized country music production system, and 24 operating at its social and spatial periphery. We f...

> Abstract Research Summary This study provides a causal explanation concerning how managerial actions using historical values contribute to dynamic capabilities, or sustaining competitive advantage in changing environments. Based on historical methods that consist mainly of hermeneutics, contextualization, and source criticism, it analyzes sources and data on how Toyota strategically responded to the competitive dynamics of the automotive industry centered around modularization. This resulted in the identification of three types of managerial action using historical values— filtering , integrating , and modifying —which have a rhetorical influence on the processes of strategic diagnosis, choice, and action respectively in ways that strengthen the microfoundations of dynamic capabilities.

> Organizations can gain substantial knowledge synergies from their alliance portfolios, and research suggests firms may benefit even more when their partners compete directly with each other. However, firms can only capture such synergies if their own inventors are allowed to freely exchange knowledge obtained from these partners to create novel combinations. We challenge this premise and argue that, because partners in such configurations are more concerned about the risks of knowledge leakage to their rivals, they will pressure the focal firm into imposing credible safeguards that restrict the access and handling of knowledge inside its organization. We predict that the constraints imposed by these safeguards will be reflected in a higher disconnectedness in the focal firm’s inventor coll...

`FT50` `UTD24` `Innovation-Related`

> This paper examines the optimal design of contests in the presence of negative prizes and establishes the optimality of a modified all-pay auction with entry fee and reserve. The entry fee always equals the contestants’ liability, and the reserve is weakly higher than in contests without negative prizes. The modification involves awarding all contestants a strictly positive prize if none meet the reserve. This optimal contest better incentivizes high-ability contestants by offering them a higher prize augmented by entry fees, while still ensuring full participation from low-ability contestants. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that when contestants’ liability is sufficiently high, the same contest maximizes both the expected total effort and winner’s effort, with both measures increasing ...

> An opaque product refers to a subset of products that only differ in some secondary attribute (such as color or style). After a customer purchases an opaque product, one of the products in the subset is then allocated to the customer. Selling opaque products has become popular on e-commerce platforms, because it is a source of flexibility that reduces demand variability and hence inventory cost. In this paper, we seek to understand how the design of opaque product configurations and the fraction of customers choosing opaque products impact the value of flexibility arising from opaque selling. The key finding from our study is the following insight: A modest opaque selling strategy where (i) the opaque options contain small subsets and (ii) only a small fraction of customers buy opaque prod...

> Using career history data from employees’ online profiles, we provide empirical evidence regarding how human resources systems can affect the gender gap in job tenure. Our results indicate that female workers experience shorter average job tenure than male workers. Our results further show that abandoning forced ranking systems helps to narrow this gender gap. We present experimental evidence indicating that in forced ranking environments, women experience shorter tenure than men and are more likely to exit their roles. This is true even when women are on equal footing with men. Finally, we present survey evidence that under forced ranking systems, more women resign as compared with men. In sum, our empirical, experimental, and survey results indicate that forced ranking systems may contri...

> We address the joint assortment and inventory optimization problem for an online retailer facing a set of N substitutable products. The retailer must determine both the assortment and inventories of these products before the start of the selling season to maximize the expected profit. We consider a setting with dynamic SOBS, where consumers’ choices follow the Markov chain choice model. This is a challenging problem, and even computing the expected profit for a given assortment and inventory solution requires solving an intractable dynamic program. We present a sample average approximation-based algorithm for the problem that achieves a regret of [Formula: see text] with respect to an linear program (LP) upper bound. Our algorithm first selects an assortment by balancing the expected reven...

> Loyalty programs are widespread across various markets, offering members rewards based on their past purchases for future benefits. This study offers new insights into the strategic use of loyalty programs and their impact on market competition by exploring the dynamics of loyalty programs within a repeated ordered search framework, in which consumers sequentially search for the optimal product across multiple firms over two periods. Our findings highlight distinct roles for price discounts and rewards in influencing consumer decisions. Price discounts discourage further search in the current shopping period, whereas rewards encourage consumer loyalty by inducing prominence in subsequent visits. As search costs increase, firms tend to offer lower price discounts but higher rewards, and thi...

> This paper examines the impact of female analyst coverage on firms’ environmental and social (E&amp;S) performance. Exploiting broker closures as a quasi-exogenous shock to analyst coverage, we find that firms experiencing an exogenous decline in female analyst coverage subsequently show a significantly larger drop in E&amp;S scores than those experiencing an equivalent decline in male analyst coverage. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we develop novel machine-learning models to analyze more than 2.4 million analyst reports and 120,000 earnings call transcripts. Our analysis shows that, compared with their male counterparts, female analysts are more likely to address E&amp;S issues, particularly those involving regulatory compliance, stakeholders, and the environment, in both research...

> Abstract This research demonstrates the impact of unconditional business-to-consumer (B2C) gifts. It contributes to the literature by examining how an unconditional gift at the beginning of a shopping experience can influence both loyalty and transactional spending. The findings show that an unconditional gift creates feelings of gratitude, driving loyalty and transactional spending. At the same time, receiving such a gift can lead to a sense of obligation, prompting increased transactional spending to alleviate this feeling. To address the identified gaps in research on B2C gift giving and provide managers a clear path to successfully launch an unconditional gift-giving program, we conduct two firm-partnered field experiments, tracking the behaviors of customers after receipt of an uncond...

**Authors:** Yuansheng Wei, Hang Wei, Lin Tian, Baojun Jiang

**Journal:** Information Systems Research (ISR) | **Published:** 2026-02-05

`FT50` `UTD24` `Innovation-Related`

> Digital content platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch rely on third-party providers and share advertising revenue to incentivize content production. Yet, as providers increasingly distribute content across multiple platforms, competition intensifies and platforms consider exclusive contracts to restrict providers’ multihoming behavior. Our research develops an analytical model to examine when exclusive contracts benefit or harm platforms, providers, consumers, and overall welfare. We find that exclusivity has two key forces: it limits the number of providers on each platform, reducing same-side crowding, but it also weakens the effectiveness of revenue sharing as a competitive tool for attracting providers. As a result, exclusivity benefits platforms only when consumers place low m...

> When a data breach happens, both victims, whose data were breached, and nonvictims react negatively but not equally so. In this study, we used Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica data breach to identify to what extent reactions of data breach victims go beyond those of nonvictims. Our findings reveal that victims initially lose more trust, feel more violated, feel more strongly that a psychological contract has been breached, feel less belonging on Facebook, and intend to continue using Facebook less. However, these effects are short-lived, disappearing within six months. Intuitively, one might assume that this is because people are locked in on Facebook and are forced to change their attitudes because they cannot change their behavior by leaving it. Surprisingly, a follow-up experiment shows t...

> Problem definition: Motivated by major e-commerce platforms’ diverse practices in bestseller information provision, this paper examines consumers’ learning, searching, and purchasing behavior under uncertainty about products’ values, whereas a revenue-maximizing platform strategically decides whether and, if so, how to disclose products’ past sales information to consumers. Methodology/results: We analyze a two-period Bayesian learning model that embeds consumers’ sequential product search in a social learning framework and shows how the interaction between bestseller information and consumer search impacts sales and welfare. We find that a bestseller list constitutes an informative yet noisy signal about the products’ values. The informativeness of the signal is determined by the granular...

`FT50` `UTD24`

> We deal with a retailer’s multi-product inventory system where customers randomly seek acceptable substitutes if their initial requests are not satisfied. Unsuccessful quests for substitutes would result in lost sales. Motivated by a consulting project as well as other real practices, we also choose to deal with further challenges posed by initially unknown base demand distributions and substitution probabilities; moreover, we aim to develop an offline learning method that (i) takes advantage of given data derived from bygone decisions rather than of any learning-while-doing opportunity, (ii) makes inferences about base-demand distributions and pairwise substitution probabilities without knowing whether there have been demand arrivals after inventory depletions, and (iii) is unhindered by ...

**Authors:** Sheng Ji, Yi Yang

`FT50` `UTD24`

> Product returns are prevalent in practice. Many retailers provide lenient free return policies but with specific return window within which customers are allowed to return products. Motivated by this phenomenon, we consider a single-product online learning and pricing problem with stochastic product returns. A salient feature is that the demand function, depending on price and return window decisions, is initially unknown and must be learned on the fly. The retailer thus faces the classic exploration-exploitation trade-off. Moreover, we consider an inventory constraint, introducing an additional trade-off between earning revenue and managing inventory. We propose a modeling framework to integrate pricing and return window decisions, and develop a deterministic fluid model that serves as th...

`FT50` `UTD24`

> Popularity bias, reflects the positive impact of popularity information on consumer choices. There are two common display formats for popularity information on online retail platforms: the total-based cumulative sales format, where the total sales of a product are displayed since its launch, and the period-based cumulative sales format, where only sales within a specific recent period are shown. Both types of popularity information are continuously updated. This paper focuses on the multiproduct dynamic pricing problem with popularity bias. We employ the widely used multinomial logit model (MNL) to investigate the impact of popularity bias on consumer choices. In particular, we examine how popularity bias affects marginal revenue, pricing decisions, and market shares. Moreover, we highligh...

**Authors:** Junyu Cao, Wei Qi, Yan Zhang

**Journal:** Manufacturing & Service Operations Management (MSOM) | **Published:** 2026-02-02

`FT50` `UTD24`

> Problem definition: A shift toward shopping at (autonomous) wheeled vending stores is redefining urban retail. Compared with traditional brick-and-mortar stores, such mobile stores are cost efficient to deploy and adaptive to fast-evolving business environments. However, mobile stores are confronted with unknown demand and limited capacity. Store mobility enables demand learning and profit maximization, yet an optimal dynamic store location policy remains unclear. Methodology/results: We model this “learning-and-earning” problem by taking optimistic actions under parameter uncertainty. The joint optimization over parameter and action set is complicated by the combinatorial nature and infinite choices within the action set. We overcome these challenges by leveraging continuous-approximation...

> Problem definition: Supply chain financing solutions allow financially weaker suppliers to secure funding based on the stronger financial standing of their buyers, presenting an alternative to conventional financing. This paper explores the preferences between immediate-tier financing (involving a direct buyer of the supplier) and remote-tier financing (involving a buyer’s buyer). Methodology/results: Using a model of a three-tier supply chain and a financial market, we solve for the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium for a game comprising supply chain financing supergame and financing subgames between a firm and investors, subject to equilibrium pricing of firms’ assets-in-place and moral hazard frictions. The game is dynamic and stochastic because production shocks and financing subgames o...

> Multiasset Optimal Execution via Deep Learning for High-Dimensional Continuous-Time Stochastic Control In “Deep Learning for High-Dimensional Continuous-Time Stochastic Optimal Control Without Explicit Solution,” Dupret and Hainaut introduce the generalized policy iteration physics-informed neural network, a novel deep learning algorithm for solving high-dimensional continuous-time stochastic optimal control problems even when the optimal control does not admit explicit solution. The method combines physics-informed neural networks with an actor-critic structure based on generalized policy iteration and uses separate networks to approximate both the value function and the multidimensional optimal control. This approach provides a global approximation of the solution across time and space, ...

> The paper “Pre-hedging” studies a dealer that pre-hedges an anticipated potential trade and analyses how this affects the client’s overall execution outcome. It shows that pre-hedging can benefit both parties: Improved risk management over an extended horizon then enables the dealer to charge reduced spreads that more than offset any adverse impact the pre-hedging activity has on the execution price. However, when a dealer pre-hedges too aggressively, this can be detrimental to the client. Timing uncertainty of the potential trade is an effective control held by the client to mitigate any counterproductive pre-hedging. Our results are robust to a setting where competing dealers simultaneously pre-hedge.

> From Loot Boxes to Better Design: Pricing Randomized Products Randomized rewards—often described as “mystery packs” or “blind-box” mechanics—are now a familiar feature in many video games. Yet choosing a loot box’s price and the odds of each possible drop is not just a design decision; it is a challenging optimization problem. In their accepted Operations Research paper, “Algorithms for loot box design” (Han, Ryan, and Tong, forthcoming), the authors develop an algorithmic framework for designing loot boxes by selecting a purchase price and item drop probabilities to maximize expected revenue under player choice behavior. They show that the general problem is computationally hard, but also identify economically motivated restrictions on player utilities that make the design problem tractab...

> Why do low-skilled gig workers remain stuck in work they originally intended as temporary? Although gig work is widely portrayed as flexible and temporary, our study shows that platforms can gradually trap workers in place. Drawing on grounded theory and fieldwork—including 70 interviews with 42 food delivery riders and 14 ride-hailing drivers, 30 hours of firsthand riding experience, and observations of online communities totalling 820 riders—this study develops a conceptual framework of career development lock, identifying four interrelated forms: lock-out, lock-in, lock-up, and lock-down. We find that career development lock stems from a structural conflict between workers’ long-term aspirations, grounded in a continuous temporal narrative, and platform algorithms’ need for flexible, on...

> The United States and other countries enacted various policies aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19. Though the pandemic itself took a physical, psychological, and economic toll on society, it is unclear how specific containment policies influenced longer term aspects of employment. Taking up this challenge, this research uses human agency theory to study the effects of U.S. state policy COVID-19 strictness, defined along the spectrum from the absence to the presence (e.g., none, recommended, and mandated) of nine containment policies, on critical macro and micro outcomes. Study 1, using an objective measure of public containment policies enacted during 2020, finds stricter policies (i.e., more restrictions) negatively related to opportunity-based entrepreneurship in 2021.

> ABSTRACT New ventures are expected to continuously add new jobs and managerial positions to meet the expanding demands of scaling. However, the rapid pace and inherent uncertainty of scaling often lead founders of new ventures to rely on heuristics when making these critical hiring and managerial appointment decisions. By integrating research on scaling, cognition in decision‐making, and gender stereotypes with literature on HR practices, we argue that such heuristics can exacerbate reliance on gender stereotypes rather than the actual competencies of potential candidates. Using matched employer‐employee census data covering all new ventures established and led by solo male founders in Sweden between 2004 and 2018, we find that scaling decreases the likelihood of hiring females for job pos...

**Journal:** Contemporary Accounting Research (CAR) | **Published:** 2026-02-05

> ABSTRACT This article studies how the mandatory disclosure of audit risk and targeted regulatory inspections influence audit quality. We develop a model in which the auditor tests a firm's internal control over financial reporting before auditing the financial report and must issue an opinion on both. Due to higher regulatory scrutiny received by audits with weak internal control opinions, we show that targeted inspections generate countervailing effects: they reduce the auditor's internal control audit effort while increasing substantive testing effort. We show that a positive level of targeted inspections can improve audit quality when the level of random inspections is high. Furthermore, we show that targeted inspections are not always consistent with risk‐based inspections, due to the ...

> ABSTRACT This paper studies how partisan alignment between city leaders and state governors shapes information processing and bond pricing in the municipal bond market. Using a novel data set on 1,045 U.S. cities from 2005 to 2019, we show that cities with the same political affiliation as the state governor face 9 basis points lower borrowing costs than misaligned cities. The effect is stronger for riskier bonds, in states where governors hold greater authority, and for fiscally dependent cities. Aligned cities also receive more aid during fiscal distress. Partisan alignment shapes how investors interpret and respond to financial information: Nondisclosure and adverse audit findings raise borrowing costs primarily for misaligned cities, while penalties for aligned cities are markedly smal...

> ABSTRACT Companies across industries face increasing pressure to assess the costs of decarbonizing their operations. This paper develops a generic model for constructing abatement cost curves in connection with carbon dioxide emissions. The resulting abatement cost curves provide a planning tool for companies seeking to project their decarbonization pathways and to determine optimal abatement levels in response to environmental regulations such as carbon pricing. We calibrate our model in the context of European cement producers that are required to obtain emission permits under the European Emissions Trading System. We find that a price of €85 per ton of carbon dioxide, as observed on average in 2023, incentivizes firms to reduce their annual direct emissions by about one-third relative t...

> ABSTRACT We examine how audit firms changed their policies regarding audit partner performance measurement, career development, and compensation during a period of heightened public scrutiny of audit quality (2007 to 2017). We theorize how implementing policy changes requires a delicate transition in the organizational design and internal processes of the firms and may not effectively translate into their day-to-day practices. Our access to proprietary performance management policies and individual partner performance and compensation data from the eight largest Dutch audit firms allows us to gain an in-depth understanding of the evolution of performance management for audit partners. We find that most of the policy changes have real consequences. For example, audit quality becomes more co...

> ABSTRACT Audit senior associates are essential to audit production, yet we know little about how they experience their organizational role. We interview 45 U.S.-based audit seniors and find they experience persistent paradoxical tensions between contradictory yet interrelated objectives, stemming from their middle hierarchical position as both experienced associates and novice executives. Applying Paradox Theory, we find seniors sometimes work around paradox by attending to one paradoxical objective to temporarily alleviate tension but leave the other paradoxical objective neglected. Other times, seniors work through paradox by dynamically engaging with both paradoxical objectives, particularly when empowered by perceiving adequate resources—time, information, and social capital.

> ABSTRACT This paper investigates how consulting services affect audit quality, from the perspective of knowledge- and expertise-sharing between employees. Semistructured interviews with 16 audit partners reveal that consulting expertise is used in 60–80 percent of audit engagements, with the main rationale for such collaboration being knowledge-sharing and improved audit quality. We leverage a comprehensive office-level dataset of employment profiles covering 86 percent of all employees at large U.S. public accounting firms to systematically investigate the effect of consulting employees on audit quality. We document that a one standard deviation increase in the share of consulting employees in an office results in a 2.6 percentage point reduction in restatements (a decrease of 19 percent ...

We use granular large-scale data to provide institutionally relevant novel descriptive evidence motivated by this hotly debated accounting standard. Comparing goodwill versus other acquired intangibles growth rates for firms reporting goodwill throughout the 2010–2020 post-FAS 141(R) period provides no evidence of runaway goodwill inflation concerns. For firms with goodwill anytime during 2010–2020 we use Shapley values to explore the explanatory power of performance factors affecting goodwill impairments. Consistent with standard-setters’ intent, single-segment market performance explains 81 percent...

We develop a two-sided audit framework to evaluate demographic bias in LLM-generated investment advice and apply it to multiple large language models, with GPT-4 Turbo as the primary baseline. On the investor side, fund selections are similar across demographic groups and rely on financial criteria, but recommended investment amounts vary when investor names signal race or gender, despite identical age and income. On the fund manager side, capital allocations favor non-Black and male managers: racial disparities persist even under explicit disclosure, while gender-related differences are more pronounced under name-based cues. Bias patterns are qualitatively similar acr...

> Abstract Many companies create private governance—collectively designed arrangements such as ecological or social standards that guide corporate conduct. Yet explanations for why firms engage in such governance creation remain fragmented across a wide range of studies and disciplines. This article synthesizes existing research into a comprehensive framework that integrates macro-level institutional conditions with meso- and micro-level drivers and barriers, thereby clarifying the antecedents of corporate engagement in the creation of private governance. We also develop a research agenda addressing these gaps within debates on political corporate social responsibility (PCSR). While PCSR articulates normative ideals of legitimate corporate engagement, empirical findings show governance creat...
