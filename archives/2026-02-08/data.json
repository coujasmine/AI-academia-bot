    "abstract": "Abstract This research demonstrates the impact of unconditional business-to-consumer (B2C) gifts. It contributes to the literature by examining how an unconditional gift at the beginning of a shopping experience can influence both loyalty and transactional spending. The findings show that an unconditional gift creates feelings of gratitude, driving loyalty and transactional spending. At the same time, receiving such a gift can lead to a sense of obligation, prompting increased transactional spending to alleviate this feeling. To address the identified gaps in research on B2C gift giving and provide managers a clear path to successfully launch an unconditional gift-giving program, we conduct two firm-partnered field experiments, tracking the behaviors of customers after receipt of an unconditional gift. We then conduct five experimental studies to validate the theoretical process and examine three managerially relevant contingencies: value of the gift, new versus existing customers, and a promotional reward versus an unconditional gift. We find that even unconditional gifts with little monetary value provide benefits for a firm and the effects are robust across new and existing customers. Furthermore, we find that unconditional gifts create greater feelings of obligation than promotional rewards. Managers can use our findings to design unconditional gift-giving programs regarding when, what, and how unconditional gifts should be given to have the largest impact on customers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Do large language models (LLMs) generate unbiased financial advice across investor and fund manager demographics? We develop a two-sided audit framework to evaluate demographic bias in LLM-generated investment advice and apply it to multiple large language models, with GPT-4 Turbo as the primary baseline. On the investor side, fund selections are similar across demographic groups and rely on financial criteria, but recommended investment amounts vary when investor names signal race or gender, despite identical age and income. On the fund manager side, capital allocations favor non-Black and male managers: racial disparities persist even under explicit disclosure, while gender-related differences are more pronounced under name-based cues. Bias patterns are qualitatively similar across models, with differences in magnitude between implicit and explicit demographic signaling. These results suggest that, even when LLMs incorporate core financial reasoning, demographic signals can affect allocation decisions, with effects that tend to be stronger under implicit signaling, potentially replicating existing market inequalities and raising concerns about impartiality in financial advising. The proposed audit framework provides a generalizable approach for identifying and evaluating demographic bias in AI-driven financial advisory systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Research Summary We examine how entrepreneur‐expressed humility affects early stage investors' willingness to fund new ventures. In pitching contexts where investors rely on relational cues and implicit prototypes of entrepreneurs, we theorize three distinct pathways through which expressed humility shapes funding decisions. First, building on research regarding interpersonal signals in early stage valuation, we propose that humility fosters perceptions of interpersonal affect and trust and team‐building qualities, increasing investors' willingness to fund. Second, drawing on implicit leadership theories, we argue that humility may trigger negative perceptions regarding the entrepreneur's ability to make rapid and risky decisions. Across a videometric analysis of 140 real‐world pitches and a randomized experiment with French early stage investors, we show that expressed humility elicits both pathways, but investors prioritize positive attributions. Managerial Summary Although humility is often regarded as a positive leadership trait, it contradicts implicit prototypes of successful entrepreneurs, who are typically seen as dominant and assertive. We examine how early stage investors perceive and respond to displays of humility during pitches. We propose that entrepreneur‐expressed humility produces ambiguous effects: It enhances perceptions of interpersonal affect and trust and team‐building qualities, but raises doubts about the entrepreneur's ability to make rapid and risky decisions. Using a videometric analysis of 140 pitches from the French version of Shark Tank and a randomized experiment with venture capital investors, we find evidence for these competing pathways. Overall, investors prioritize the positive attributions of interpersonal skills, suggesting that entrepreneurs benefit from expressing humility when pitching.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent research has shown how cycles of globalization and deglobalization can disrupt firms and networks. Understanding this process requires a historical perspective on how firms and networks coordinate, strategize, and respond to the effects of deglobalization. This paper examines firm‐level, network‐enabled strategic responses to deglobalization by analysing a selection of key firms operating within the Liverpool (UK) and New York (USA) networks at the turn of the nineteenth century. The case study analyses firms within a broader network structure through network visualization, supplemented by various archival data sources. We explore the strategic responses of multiple firms and demonstrate how the network supported them, enabling them to address the challenges posed by deglobalization. We identify five categories of network‐enabled strategic responses to deglobalization: reinforcement, adaptation, shared risk, lobbying, and exit.",

    "abstract": "Why do low-skilled gig workers remain stuck in work they originally intended as temporary? Although gig work is widely portrayed as flexible and temporary, our study shows that platforms can gradually trap workers in place. Drawing on grounded theory and fieldwork—including 70 interviews with 42 food delivery riders and 14 ride-hailing drivers, 30 hours of firsthand riding experience, and observations of online communities totalling 820 riders—this study develops a conceptual framework of career development lock, identifying four interrelated forms: lock-out, lock-in, lock-up, and lock-down. We find that career development lock stems from a structural conflict between workers’ long-term aspirations, grounded in a continuous temporal narrative, and platform algorithms’ need for flexible, on-demand labor that operates through a fragmented temporal logic. This conflict generates short-term person–career fit but long-term misfit. Under the structural constraints of algorithmic management, workers turn to adaptive self-exploitation, intensifying short-term fit while undermining long-term misfit, which ultimately traps them in their roles. The study advances understanding of non-linear careers in non-standard employment and reframes algorithmic control as a career-structuring force beyond a day-to-day control mechanism. It also offers practical implications for platforms and policymakers to prevent new forms of career entrapment in the gig economy.",

Van Iddekinge, Robert E. Ployhart and Tom D. Heetderks (<i>Journal of Applied Psychology</i>, 2018[Aug], Vol 103[8], 916-928; see record 2018-16525-001). In the article, in Table 1, most of the values in the columns for Variables 2 and 3 were incorrectly transposed. The columns with the corrected values are shown in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-16525-001). At some point, hiring managers in all organizations face the decision of whether to fill open positions with internal candidates (e.g., through promotions) or to hire external candidates (e.g., from competitors or new entrants into the labor market). Despite this ubiquitous choice, surprisingly little research has compared the effectiveness of internal and external selection or has identified situations in which 1 approach may be better than the other. The authors use theory on human capital resources to predict differences between internal and external hires on manager- and unit-level outcomes. Analysis of data from a quick-service retail organization (N = 3,697) suggested that internally hired managers demonstrated higher levels of individual job performance and commanded lower starting salaries than externally hired managers. At the unit-level, operations led by internal hires demonstrated higher performance on organization-specific criteria (i.e., service performance), whereas no internal-external differences were found on more general criteria (i.e., financial performance). They also found some evidence that differences in unit service performance decreased over time (but did not diminish completely) as external hires improved at a slightly faster rate than internal hires. Overall, these findings underscore the complexity of the recurring \"build or buy\" decision. The results also suggest that internal hires generally outperform external hires, both individually and collectively, and they do so for less money.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article studies how the mandatory disclosure of audit risk and targeted regulatory inspections influence audit quality. We develop a model in which the auditor tests a firm's internal control over financial reporting before auditing the financial report and must issue an opinion on both. Due to higher regulatory scrutiny received by audits with weak internal control opinions, we show that targeted inspections generate countervailing effects: they reduce the auditor's internal control audit effort while increasing substantive testing effort. We show that a positive level of targeted inspections can improve audit quality when the level of random inspections is high. Furthermore, we show that targeted inspections are not always consistent with risk‐based inspections, due to the auditor's strategic response to the oversight measures. Nevertheless, such targeting can still result in higher audit quality. Our results suggest the need to exercise caution when using audit risk disclosures as a basis for enforcement.",

    "abstract": "Digital content platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch rely on third-party providers and share advertising revenue to incentivize content production. Yet, as providers increasingly distribute content across multiple platforms, competition intensifies and platforms consider exclusive contracts to restrict providers’ multihoming behavior. Our research develops an analytical model to examine when exclusive contracts benefit or harm platforms, providers, consumers, and overall welfare. We find that exclusivity has two key forces: it limits the number of providers on each platform, reducing same-side crowding, but it also weakens the effectiveness of revenue sharing as a competitive tool for attracting providers. As a result, exclusivity benefits platforms only when consumers place low marginal value on content, leading platforms to offer lower sharing rates and earn higher profits. When consumer valuation is high, exclusivity can backfire, reducing platform profits. Importantly, exclusivity can increase provider surplus and even generate win–win outcomes for both platforms and providers at intermediate valuation levels. Although exclusivity reduces consumer surplus because of fewer providers, total social welfare may still increase because of reduced competition costs among providers. These findings suggest policymakers should take a nuanced stance toward regulating content exclusivity.",

The method combines physics-informed neural networks with an actor-critic structure based on generalized policy iteration and uses separate networks to approximate both the value function and the multidimensional optimal control. This approach provides a global approximation of the solution across time and space, enabling fast online evaluation. Theoretical guarantees on convergence and optimality are provided, whereas its accuracy and efficacy are empirically validated through two important numerical examples from operations research. Thereby, the authors generalize the Almgren–Chriss framework arising from optimal execution in finance by allowing both temporary and permanent price impacts to be fully nonlinear and by considering a multidimensional setting with multiple cointegrated assets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Research Summary This study provides a causal explanation concerning how managerial actions using historical values contribute to dynamic capabilities, or sustaining competitive advantage in changing environments. Based on historical methods that consist mainly of hermeneutics, contextualization, and source criticism, it analyzes sources and data on how Toyota strategically responded to the competitive dynamics of the automotive industry centered around modularization. This resulted in the identification of three types of managerial action using historical values— filtering , integrating , and modifying —which have a rhetorical influence on the processes of strategic diagnosis, choice, and action respectively in ways that strengthen the microfoundations of dynamic capabilities. This enables the firm to adapt to hyper‐competitive environments while maintaining the idiosyncrasies of its core capabilities. Managerial Summary Toyota has sustained its competitive advantage for decades by consistently relying on its core capabilities, especially the Toyota Production System and its longstanding supplier relations. How has Toyota been able to do so while facing rapidly changing environments? This paper seeks to explore this question by comparing Toyota's and Nissan's strategies in response to modularization in the automotive industry in the 1990s and 2000s. It uncovers how a firm's managers can utilize historical values in ways that influence the processes of strategy formation and implementation. This allows the firm to incorporate key elements of new strategies that its rivals introduce in the marketplace alongside the firm's strategies based on its core capabilities, thereby adapting to hyper‐competitive environments while sustaining its idiosyncrasies and competitive advantage.",

    "abstract": "Organizations can gain substantial knowledge synergies from their alliance portfolios, and research suggests firms may benefit even more when their partners compete directly with each other. However, firms can only capture such synergies if their own inventors are allowed to freely exchange knowledge obtained from these partners to create novel combinations. We challenge this premise and argue that, because partners in such configurations are more concerned about the risks of knowledge leakage to their rivals, they will pressure the focal firm into imposing credible safeguards that restrict the access and handling of knowledge inside its organization. We predict that the constraints imposed by these safeguards will be reflected in a higher disconnectedness in the focal firm’s inventor collaboration network, with the extent of these constraints tied to the relative technological bargaining power the focal firm holds over its partners. Importantly, these safeguards are not costless, and we predict that the disconnectedness induced will affect the focal firm’s innovation performance by undermining its ability to create and appropriate inventive value. Using a longitudinal sample of pharmaceutical firms, we find consistent support for these arguments. Our study contributes to research on interfirm alliances, intraorganizational networks, and innovation while offering practical insights for managers.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the optimal design of contests in the presence of negative prizes and establishes the optimality of a modified all-pay auction with entry fee and reserve. The entry fee always equals the contestants’ liability, and the reserve is weakly higher than in contests without negative prizes. The modification involves awarding all contestants a strictly positive prize if none meet the reserve. This optimal contest better incentivizes high-ability contestants by offering them a higher prize augmented by entry fees, while still ensuring full participation from low-ability contestants. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that when contestants’ liability is sufficiently high, the same contest maximizes both the expected total effort and winner’s effort, with both measures increasing with liability. Numerical simulations show that even with low liability, predictions from the two optimal contests are closely aligned. To test these predictions, we conduct an experiment comparing optimal contests across different liability levels, confirming the “killing-two-birds-with-one-stone” prediction.

    "abstract": "An opaque product refers to a subset of products that only differ in some secondary attribute (such as color or style). After a customer purchases an opaque product, one of the products in the subset is then allocated to the customer. Selling opaque products has become popular on e-commerce platforms, because it is a source of flexibility that reduces demand variability and hence inventory cost. In this paper, we seek to understand how the design of opaque product configurations and the fraction of customers choosing opaque products impact the value of flexibility arising from opaque selling. The key finding from our study is the following insight: A modest opaque selling strategy where (i) the opaque options contain small subsets and (ii) only a small fraction of customers buy opaque products achieves substantial cost savings (compared with nonopaque traditional selling). Moreover, the cost savings of this modest opaque strategy is on the same order as a fully flexible scenario where all customers buy an opaque product. Our analysis relies on exploring a novel connection of multiproduct inventory management to the balls-into-bins framework along with a simple balancing policy for opaque selling. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show that the simple balancing policy is asymptotically optimal. For extensions outside of our theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that our core insights continue to hold.

Our results indicate that female workers experience shorter average job tenure than male workers. Our results further show that abandoning forced ranking systems helps to narrow this gender gap. We present experimental evidence indicating that in forced ranking environments, women experience shorter tenure than men and are more likely to exit their roles. This is true even when women are on equal footing with men. Finally, we present survey evidence that under forced ranking systems, more women resign as compared with men. In sum, our empirical, experimental, and survey results indicate that forced ranking systems may contribute to a gender gap in job tenure.

    "abstract": "We address the joint assortment and inventory optimization problem for an online retailer facing a set of N substitutable products. The retailer must determine both the assortment and inventories of these products before the start of the selling season to maximize the expected profit. We consider a setting with dynamic SOBS, where consumers’ choices follow the Markov chain choice model. This is a challenging problem, and even computing the expected profit for a given assortment and inventory solution requires solving an intractable dynamic program. We present a sample average approximation-based algorithm for the problem that achieves a regret of [Formula: see text] with respect to an linear program (LP) upper bound. Our algorithm first selects an assortment by balancing the expected revenue (from a single consumer) and the inventory cost. We do this by identifying a subset of products that can pool demand from the universe of substitutable products without significantly cannibalizing the revenue in the presence of dynamic substitution behavior of consumers. We then use a sample average approximation-based LP to decide on the inventory level for each item in the selected assortment. We numerically show that our algorithm considerably improves the performance over standard approaches from the literature on a wide range of instances of the Markov chain choice model and demonstrate that it carefully handles the inventory of products in the long tail (i.e., products with small mean total demand).

Using a novel data set on 1,045 U.S. cities from 2005 to 2019, we show that cities with the same political affiliation as the state governor face 9 basis points lower borrowing costs than misaligned cities. The effect is stronger for riskier bonds, in states where governors hold greater authority, and for fiscally dependent cities. Aligned cities also receive more aid during fiscal distress. Partisan alignment shapes how investors interpret and respond to financial information: Nondisclosure and adverse audit findings raise borrowing costs primarily for misaligned cities, while penalties for aligned cities are markedly smaller.",

In this study, we used Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica data breach to identify to what extent reactions of data breach victims go beyond those of nonvictims. Our findings reveal that victims initially lose more trust, feel more violated, feel more strongly that a psychological contract has been breached, feel less belonging on Facebook, and intend to continue using Facebook less. However, these effects are short-lived, disappearing within six months. Intuitively, one might assume that this is because people are locked in on Facebook and are forced to change their attitudes because they cannot change their behavior by leaving it. Surprisingly, a follow-up experiment shows that this is not the case as we found people who are less locked in to improve their attitudes more over time. Our study adds to the mounting evidence that consumers are unable to act when their data are breached and their privacy is violated and that regulation may be needed to better protect data. The short-lived nature of victims’ reactions we identified in this case also raises questions about the role of postbreach compensation in different contexts.",

Yet choosing a loot box’s price and the odds of each possible drop is not just a design decision; it is a challenging optimization problem. In their accepted Operations Research paper, “Algorithms for loot box design” (Han, Ryan, and Tong, forthcoming), the authors develop an algorithmic framework for designing loot boxes by selecting a purchase price and item drop probabilities to maximize expected revenue under player choice behavior. They show that the general problem is computationally hard, but also identify economically motivated restrictions on player utilities that make the design problem tractable. When the number of items is fixed, the paper provides an exact polynomial-time algorithm under one class of utility structures and efficient approximation algorithms with provable guarantees under another. The analysis also links loot-box design to classic pricing ideas, offering guidance on how to translate item-level values and rarity into transparent, well-performing randomized reward systems.",

    "abstract": "Problem definition: Motivated by major e-commerce platforms’ diverse practices in bestseller information provision, this paper examines consumers’ learning, searching, and purchasing behavior under uncertainty about products’ values, whereas a revenue-maximizing platform strategically decides whether and, if so, how to disclose products’ past sales information to consumers. Methodology/results: We analyze a two-period Bayesian learning model that embeds consumers’ sequential product search in a social learning framework and shows how the interaction between bestseller information and consumer search impacts sales and welfare. We find that a bestseller list constitutes an informative yet noisy signal about the products’ values. The informativeness of the signal is determined by the granularity of the bestseller information. By evaluating bestseller information of two levels of granularity, sales ranking and sales volume, we discover that, although consumers benefit more from information of a higher granularity (i.e., sales volume), the platform may prefer providing information of a lower granularity (i.e., sales ranking), suggesting that the platform may withhold information at the cost of consumers. In particular, an inference effect unique to multiproduct Bayesian learning gives rise to the possibility that disclosure of sales volume backfires and hurts the platform. We demonstrate significant sales implications of bestseller information granularity and show that concave distribution functions for consumers’ search cost, a stochastic increase in product values, or a growth in consumer population can tilt the platform’s preference toward displaying bestseller rankings without revealing sales volumes. Furthermore, we show that bestseller information may lead to lower purchased value or higher search cost, the latter implying that public learning may stimulate rather than substitute private learning. Managerial implications: The paper cautions retail platform practitioners about a pitfall associated with disclosing bestseller sales volume and presents guidelines on the timing and granularity of sales information provision. The findings also suggest e-commerce platforms with consumer-centric goals enhance bestseller information transparency on their marketplaces. Funding: W.

    "abstract": "We deal with a retailer’s multi-product inventory system where customers randomly seek acceptable substitutes if their initial requests are not satisfied. Unsuccessful quests for substitutes would result in lost sales. Motivated by a consulting project as well as other real practices, we also choose to deal with further challenges posed by initially unknown base demand distributions and substitution probabilities; moreover, we aim to develop an offline learning method that (i) takes advantage of given data derived from bygone decisions rather than of any learning-while-doing opportunity, (ii) makes inferences about base-demand distributions and pairwise substitution probabilities without knowing whether there have been demand arrivals after inventory depletions, and (iii) is unhindered by the lack of knowledge about the assortments faced by customers and their purchase-or-no-purchase decisions at their individual arrivals. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator that circumvents unrealistic data requirements. Our substitution probability estimates employ carefully designed weighting schemes to facilitate rigorous theoretical analysis through tools such as the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. Both one-time substitution scenarios and more complex Markov-chain substitution patterns would be accommodated. Using large deviation tools, we establish provably optimal convergence rates of our estimates on top of consistency. The precision in parameter estimates would translate into accuracy in replenishment decisions. For inventory management, we take advantage of a submodularity property to obtain an exact algorithm for the two-product case and a good heuristic for the general multi-product problem. Computational studies based on simulated and actual data confirm the merits of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Product returns are prevalent in practice. Many retailers provide lenient free return policies but with specific return window within which customers are allowed to return products. Motivated by this phenomenon, we consider a single-product online learning and pricing problem with stochastic product returns. A salient feature is that the demand function, depending on price and return window decisions, is initially unknown and must be learned on the fly. The retailer thus faces the classic exploration-exploitation trade-off. Moreover, we consider an inventory constraint, introducing an additional trade-off between earning revenue and managing inventory. We propose a modeling framework to integrate pricing and return window decisions, and develop a deterministic fluid model that serves as the full-information benchmark. To tackle the learning problem, we design a novel nonparametric learning algorithm that seamlessly integrates inverse stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) methods. Under mild assumptions on demand and revenue functions, we establish a regret upper bound for our learning algorithm as <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mi>O</mml:mi> <mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo> <mml:msqrt> <mml:mi>W</mml:mi> <mml:mi>T</mml:mi> </mml:msqrt> <mml:mi>log</mml:mi> <mml:mspace width=\"0.2em\"/> <mml:mi>T</mml:mi> <mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo> </mml:math> , where W denotes the number of return window candidates and T denotes the time horizon. This result aligns with lower bounds established in both online pricing and multi-armed bandit (MAB) literature. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm across various environments. From an operational standpoint, retailers can use our learning framework as a decision-support tool to identify the optimal price and return window.",

    "abstract": "Popularity bias, reflects the positive impact of popularity information on consumer choices. There are two common display formats for popularity information on online retail platforms: the total-based cumulative sales format, where the total sales of a product are displayed since its launch, and the period-based cumulative sales format, where only sales within a specific recent period are shown. Both types of popularity information are continuously updated. This paper focuses on the multiproduct dynamic pricing problem with popularity bias. We employ the widely used multinomial logit model (MNL) to investigate the impact of popularity bias on consumer choices. In particular, we examine how popularity bias affects marginal revenue, pricing decisions, and market shares. Moreover, we highlight that ignoring popularity bias can lead to a suboptimal outcome. As the multiproduct dynamic pricing problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality, we propose a semi-myopic pricing policy, which is computationally tractable, and demonstrate its asymptotic optimality under both formats. Our numerical simulations further indicate that ignoring popularity bias can result in substantial revenue losses, while the semi-myopic pricing policy consistently outperforms other heuristics under both formats. Finally, empirical tests on real data provide a comprehensive procedure for identifying the most appropriate choice models, which offers practical insights for implementation.",

    "abstract": "Loyalty programs are widespread across various markets, offering members rewards based on their past purchases for future benefits. This study offers new insights into the strategic use of loyalty programs and their impact on market competition by exploring the dynamics of loyalty programs within a repeated ordered search framework, in which consumers sequentially search for the optimal product across multiple firms over two periods. Our findings highlight distinct roles for price discounts and rewards in influencing consumer decisions. Price discounts discourage further search in the current shopping period, whereas rewards encourage consumer loyalty by inducing prominence in subsequent visits. As search costs increase, firms tend to offer lower price discounts but higher rewards, and this results in a higher industry profit but lower consumer surplus. Compared with their absence, loyalty programs decrease both industry profit and consumer welfare, leading to a lose–lose outcome. Moreover, we demonstrate that, when the firms are heterogeneous in terms of their network sizes, those with larger networks tend to offer lower rewards yet achieve greater consumer loyalty in contrast to the firms with smaller networks, which compensate with higher rewards.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of female analyst coverage on firms’ environmental and social (E&amp;S) performance. Exploiting broker closures as a quasi-exogenous shock to analyst coverage, we find that firms experiencing an exogenous decline in female analyst coverage subsequently show a significantly larger drop in E&amp;S scores than those experiencing an equivalent decline in male analyst coverage. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we develop novel machine-learning models to analyze more than 2.4 million analyst reports and 120,000 earnings call transcripts. Our analysis shows that, compared with their male counterparts, female analysts are more likely to address E&amp;S issues, particularly those involving regulatory compliance, stakeholders, and the environment, in both research reports and earnings conference calls. They also display distinct cognitive and linguistic patterns when discussing E&amp;S issues. Furthermore, female analysts are more likely to issue lower stock recommendations and target prices (lower stock recommendations) following negative E&amp;S discussions in their reports (E&amp;S incidents) than male analysts. Finally, investors respond more strongly to female analysts’ negative tones when discussing E&amp;S issues. Overall, our findings suggest that gender diversity among analysts plays a significant role in shaping corporate E&amp;S practices and provide new insights into the origins of gender differences in skills within the equity analyst profession.

    "abstract": "The United States and other countries enacted various policies aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19. Though the pandemic itself took a physical, psychological, and economic toll on society, it is unclear how specific containment policies influenced longer term aspects of employment. Taking up this challenge, this research uses human agency theory to study the effects of U.S. state policy COVID-19 strictness, defined along the spectrum from the absence to the presence (e.g., none, recommended, and mandated) of nine containment policies, on critical macro and micro outcomes. Study 1, using an objective measure of public containment policies enacted during 2020, finds stricter policies (i.e., more restrictions) negatively related to opportunity-based entrepreneurship in 2021. Study 2, using the same public policy strictness measure and a national sample of 801 participants, finds strict policies in 2020 negatively related to residents' entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) in 2024, which in turn related to their entrepreneurial intentions and quality of work life (QWL). The hypothesized interaction between state policy and sex on ESE was not significant, but post hoc analysis reveals that women residing in states with stricter policies reported lower life and career satisfaction than women in states with less strict policies and that the effects of state policy strictness on career and life satisfaction were more negative for women than for men. A supplemental preregistered experimental vignette study reinforced Study 2 findings such that manipulated state policy strictness caused a decrease in ESE, entrepreneurial intentions, and QWL; manipulated ESE also had a significant effect on entrepreneurial intentions and QWL. We discuss the broader implications of these results for theory and policymaking. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2026 APA, all rights reserved).",

    "abstract": "Problem definition: A shift toward shopping at (autonomous) wheeled vending stores is redefining urban retail. Compared with traditional brick-and-mortar stores, such mobile stores are cost efficient to deploy and adaptive to fast-evolving business environments. However, mobile stores are confronted with unknown demand and limited capacity. Store mobility enables demand learning and profit maximization, yet an optimal dynamic store location policy remains unclear. Methodology/results: We model this “learning-and-earning” problem by taking optimistic actions under parameter uncertainty. The joint optimization over parameter and action set is complicated by the combinatorial nature and infinite choices within the action set. We overcome these challenges by leveraging continuous-approximation methods, and then, we propose a continuous-approximation optimistic (CA-O) learning framework under some special problem structures. Nevertheless, for more general scenarios, the problem remains intricate because of the nonconvexity in unknown parameters. We alternatively propose a CA-O faster learning algorithm by utilizing first-order approximation techniques and further proving a closed-form gradient to guarantee computational efficiency. We theoretically analyze and numerically validate the regret for the proposed algorithms. Managerial implications: In a Toronto case study, our algorithm significantly outperforms baselines. Mobile stores earn higher profits than brick-and-mortar stores through demand learning and store mobility. More broadly, this paper envisions the future landscape of urban retail enhanced by omnipresent mobile facilities. Funding: W.

    "abstract": "Problem definition: Supply chain financing solutions allow financially weaker suppliers to secure funding based on the stronger financial standing of their buyers, presenting an alternative to conventional financing. This paper explores the preferences between immediate-tier financing (involving a direct buyer of the supplier) and remote-tier financing (involving a buyer’s buyer). Methodology/results: Using a model of a three-tier supply chain and a financial market, we solve for the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium for a game comprising supply chain financing supergame and financing subgames between a firm and investors, subject to equilibrium pricing of firms’ assets-in-place and moral hazard frictions. The game is dynamic and stochastic because production shocks and financing subgames occur over time, coinciding with trade transactions between firms, and because of the stochastic evolution of information about firms’ assets-in-place affecting demand for products of each firm. We identify three economic mechanisms that stem from the relative position of firms in the supply chain and that work against remote-tier financing: risk spillover, noise accumulation, and loss of hedging options. Risk spillover occurs when a firm’s pledge of assets to secure supplier financing increases its own financing risk, affecting upstream firms and transactions. Noise accumulation refers to the greater uncertainty in forecasts of asset values, which are realized later for remote-tier buyers. The loss of the hedging option occurs because, by helping the supplier initially, the remote-tier buyer loses some of the capacity to help the immediate-tier buyer later. These mechanisms may explain challenges faced by remote-tier supply chain financing in practice. Managerial implications: The paper highlights the challenges faced by remote-tier financing and identifies conditions under which it can be favorable. It extends traditional finance models to incorporate supply chain considerations, demonstrating the importance of these factors in economic and financial decision making.

Yet explanations for why firms engage in such governance creation remain fragmented across a wide range of studies and disciplines. This article synthesizes existing research into a comprehensive framework that integrates macro-level institutional conditions with meso- and micro-level drivers and barriers, thereby clarifying the antecedents of corporate engagement in the creation of private governance. We also develop a research agenda addressing these gaps within debates on political corporate social responsibility (PCSR). While PCSR articulates normative ideals of legitimate corporate engagement, empirical findings show governance creation often serves instrumental reasons. Our framework clarifies why and under what conditions firms engage in the creation of private governance.",

    "abstract": "Careers in creative crafts are perceived to be precarious: workers face constant rejection and receive low and erratic pay. Yet, some creative craft workers handle these challenges better than others. Precarity sometimes subsides as careers progress, and the core-periphery structure that typifies creative craft production systems is navigable. This raises the question of how creative craft workers can cope productively with the precarity of craft work. We research a prominent creative craft worker collective: country music songwriters. Our study captures the voices of 90 creative craft workers, drawing on secondary interviews with 66 songwriters working at the core of Nashville’s highly corporatized country music production system, and 24 operating at its social and spatial periphery. We find that the key to coping with precarity lies in achieving supportive patterns of social embeddedness by investing in primary craft skills, advancing higher-order vocational skills, and navigating the core-periphery structure of the creative craft production system. As apprentice songwriters practice their craft and learn how to organize their songwriting routines, they become increasingly vested in the system. Once they become master songwriters, they broaden their networks by liaising more with other industry stakeholders and engage with the system more reflexively to ensure their continued relevance. Peripheral workers engage in allyship and develop ties with workers positioned at the system’s core. We incorporate these social strategies in a grounded theoretical model capturing how songwriters cope with precarity. We conjecture that elements of the model generalize theoretically towards other corporatized creative craft production systems.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT New ventures are expected to continuously add new jobs and managerial positions to meet the expanding demands of scaling. However, the rapid pace and inherent uncertainty of scaling often lead founders of new ventures to rely on heuristics when making these critical hiring and managerial appointment decisions. By integrating research on scaling, cognition in decision‐making, and gender stereotypes with literature on HR practices, we argue that such heuristics can exacerbate reliance on gender stereotypes rather than the actual competencies of potential candidates. Using matched employer‐employee census data covering all new ventures established and led by solo male founders in Sweden between 2004 and 2018, we find that scaling decreases the likelihood of hiring females for job positions and appointing females to managerial positions. However, the founder's HR education mitigates these negative effects on both female hiring and managerial appointments, while the founder's HR experience only mitigates the negative effects on female hiring decisions. We also tease out the invoked mechanisms, conduct post hoc tests, and run an extensive number of robustness tests.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Companies across industries face increasing pressure to assess the costs of decarbonizing their operations. This paper develops a generic model for constructing abatement cost curves in connection with carbon dioxide emissions. The resulting abatement cost curves provide a planning tool for companies seeking to project their decarbonization pathways and to determine optimal abatement levels in response to environmental regulations such as carbon pricing. We calibrate our model in the context of European cement producers that are required to obtain emission permits under the European Emissions Trading System. We find that a price of €85 per ton of carbon dioxide, as observed on average in 2023, incentivizes firms to reduce their annual direct emissions by about one-third relative to the status quo. Yet, this incentive increases sharply when prices rise above the benchmark of €100 per ton of carbon dioxide. Data Availability: Data used in this study are referenced in the paper and the Appendix.

We theorize how implementing policy changes requires a delicate transition in the organizational design and internal processes of the firms and may not effectively translate into their day-to-day practices. Our access to proprietary performance management policies and individual partner performance and compensation data from the eight largest Dutch audit firms allows us to gain an in-depth understanding of the evolution of performance management for audit partners. We find that most of the policy changes have real consequences. For example, audit quality becomes more consequential to career development, whereas profit sharing becomes better linked to quality and long-term performance. We conclude that audit firms appear effectively responsive to public scrutiny, increasingly aligning partner incentives with societal expectations of audit quality.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Audit senior associates are essential to audit production, yet we know little about how they experience their organizational role. We interview 45 U.S.-based audit seniors and find they experience persistent paradoxical tensions between contradictory yet interrelated objectives, stemming from their middle hierarchical position as both experienced associates and novice executives. Applying Paradox Theory, we find seniors sometimes work around paradox by attending to one paradoxical objective to temporarily alleviate tension but leave the other paradoxical objective neglected. Other times, seniors work through paradox by dynamically engaging with both paradoxical objectives, particularly when empowered by perceiving adequate resources—time, information, and social capital. Our study reconceptualizes seniors as self-directed fledgling leaders whose capabilities are forged through navigating paradoxical tensions, expanding the conventional academic view of seniors as experienced associates. We discuss how audit firm-level tensions revealed through seniors’ experiences offer insights for human capital development and audit quality.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper investigates how consulting services affect audit quality, from the perspective of knowledge- and expertise-sharing between employees. Semistructured interviews with 16 audit partners reveal that consulting expertise is used in 60–80 percent of audit engagements, with the main rationale for such collaboration being knowledge-sharing and improved audit quality. We leverage a comprehensive office-level dataset of employment profiles covering 86 percent of all employees at large U.S. public accounting firms to systematically investigate the effect of consulting employees on audit quality. We document that a one standard deviation increase in the share of consulting employees in an office results in a 2.6 percentage point reduction in restatements (a decrease of 19 percent relative to the baseline). This effect is strongest when consulting employees have skills complimentary to auditors, e.g., technical and human resources skills, and when consultants have specific industry expertise in the same industry as the audit client.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Concerns that goodwill impairments unresponsiveness to declining performance produces inflated goodwill led standard-setters to reconsider post-acquisition impairment-only accounting. We use granular large-scale data to provide institutionally relevant novel descriptive evidence motivated by this hotly debated accounting standard. Comparing goodwill versus other acquired intangibles growth rates for firms reporting goodwill throughout the 2010–2020 post-FAS 141(R) period provides no evidence of runaway goodwill inflation concerns. For firms with goodwill anytime during 2010–2020 we use Shapley values to explore the explanatory power of performance factors affecting goodwill impairments. Consistent with standard-setters’ intent, single-segment market performance explains 81 percent of goodwill impairment incidence variation (controlling for Fama-French-38 industry and time fixed-effects). Limited evidence of reduced impairment incidence after incorporating FASB sanctioned control premia or alternative market values provides little support for discretionary impairment avoidance. Conversely, higher impairment incidence when book values incorporate IFRS (2020) proposed off-balance-sheet headroom or market-to-book decreases supports discretionary impairment recognition.
